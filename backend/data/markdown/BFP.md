287Biceps femoris perforator flap (Lateral-distal thigh flap)
 BICEPS FEMORIS PERFORATOR FLAP (LATERAL-DISTAL  
THIGH FLAP)
The posterolateral region of the thigh is vascularized by 
several arteries from different sources and several angio -
somes overlap each other in this area. Consequently, some 
confusion exists about flaps harvested on this region.
Baek in 1983(8) has been credited with the description 
of the posterolateral thigh region as a donor area for skin 
flaps. Baek described the “Posterolateral free flap” that 
was based on an artery from the third perforator of the 
profunda femoris artery. 
Later, in 1989(88), described the vascular anatomy of 
what he called the “Lower posterolateral thigh flap” based 
on a direct cutaneous branch from the popliteal artery 
(96% of cases) and made a distinction with the “middle 
posterolateral thigh flap” described by Baek in the 1980s. 
The flap described by Laitung is also sometimes described 
as the “Lateral-distal thigh skin flap”(99). It is nourished by a 
cutaneous branch arising from the first collateral branch 
of the popliteal artery, or the “Lateral superior genicular 
artery flap”, based on the cutaneous perforator from the 
Lateral superior genicular artery (branch of the popliteal 
artery) Hayashi 1990(52). Angrigiani et al. also described, 
in 1995, a pedicled musculocutaneous flap, based on the 
third perforator from the profunda femoris artery. As Cavadas et al. stated(15), “…the exact origin of these 
perforators may not be as important in the clinical setting 
as is its location relative to bony landmarks”.
Indications
As a regional pedicled flap it is useful to repair local 
defects around the knee(169). While as a free flap it has 
been used for upper limb Cavadas(15), head and neck re-
construction Hayden(55,56).
Anatomy and vascularization
Vascular supply for the biceps femoris perforator flap 
comes from a large cutaneous branch (CB) arising from 
the Lateral superior genicular artery (first collateral) of 
the Popliteal artery. It emerges in a triangle formed anteri-
orly by the Vastus Lateralis, posteriorly by the short head 
of the biceps femoris and inferiorly by the lateral condyle 
of the femur at approximately 10 cm proximal to the knee 
joint. This is the pivot point of the flap. The vessels with 
all the areolar tissue around, can be isolated and the flap 
pivoted and rotated as a propeller flap.
Figure 7.26. Vascular supply of the Biceps femoris 
perforator flap (Lateral-distal thigh flap), The First 
collateral branch (FCB) arises from the popliteal 
artery. Distal to the adductor hiatus it gives some 
muscular branches to the Vastus Lateralis and bi -
ceps, finally it extends like a large cutaneous branch 
(CB) that emerges between the Fascia Latae and the 
distal portion of the biceps femoris.

accurate and better information 
about any perforator reaching 
the skin.
Markings
Outlining starts by marking the knee joint line and lo -
calizing the tendon of the biceps femoris. A line is traced 
over the tendon and muscular belly of the biceps muscle. 
It is over that line that perforators will arise from the biceps 
muscle. A depression between the posterior border of the 
Fascia Latae and the Biceps Femoris can be easily local -
ized (it can be “felt” pressing with the fingertip), it indicates the emergence point of the pedicle, that is usually about 
10 cm proximal to the articular space.The skin paddle is 
outlined around this “emergence” point and can measure 
up to 18 cm length x 7 cm wide(99). See legends below.
Elevation
See pictures and legends below.
B A
Figure 7.27. A) Tendon of the biceps femoris (BFT) is easily localized near its insertion at the lateral aspect of the Knee and marked out. B) The knee 
joint line (doted grey line) is traced on the lateral aspect, from this line and over the biceps tendon, two points are marked proximally at 5 and 10 cm. 
They represent the approximate emerging points of perforator vessels.

Figure 7.29. The flap is incised 
initially from the anterior border 
and elevated over the Fascia La -
tae (which is not included into 
the flap). Elevation is carefully 
performed as perforators can 
arise all along the axis of the bi -
ceps femoris (black arrow).
Figure 7.30. Every perforator has 
to be identified and preserved 
until it is decided which one will 
be used as a pedicle.
Figure 7.31. If distal rotation is 
planned, the more distal perfo -
rator has to be identified. It has 
to be carefully isolated with a 
generous cuff of loose areolar 
tissue. Damage to this vessel 
will definitively challenge ade -
quate rotation of the flap.

Lower Limb290Figure 7.32. Based on the distal 
perforator, the flap can be rotat -
ed downward as a propeller flap 
to cover the anterior, posterior 
or lateral aspects of the knee. If 
this is the case, upper perfora -
tors (white arrows) are divided. 
Figure 7.33. Anterior rotation of 
the flap. As can be seen it can 
also rotate very easily to the 
posterior and lateral aspect of 
the knee.
