143Parascapular perforator flap
Manchot described the arterial anatomy of this area 
in 1889(70), mentioning that vessels arising from a trian -
gular space of the dorsal trunk vascularize the skin terri -
tory over the scapula; being the main artery, the Circum -
flex Scapular artery (CSA). This vessel gives off some 
cutaneous branches that can vascularize four different 
flaps: ascending (ascending scapular branch), horizon -
tal (scapular branch), descending (parascapular branch) 
and anterior (posterior circumflex humeral artery)(40,42,89) 
(see fig. 5.92). A single cutaneous nerve does not inner -
vate this skin territory and so it cannot be raised as a 
sensitive flap.
Indications
As a cutaneous pedicled flap or as an island flap, it 
can entirely cover the axilla and reach the deltoid area if 
necessary. Any of its variations can be used as a free flap. 
Its anatomical consistency, donor site morbidity, variety 
of shape and well as its design and the possibility to in-
clude bone with the flap(36,93,97,100), makes this flap a highly 
versatile and reliable choice. However, depending on the type, shape and size of the flap, the donor area can be 
repaired by primary closing.
Vascularization
The subscapular artery branches off from the dis-
tal third of the axillary artery. It quickly divides into the 
Thoracodorsal and the Circumflex scapular arteries. Af-
ter passing beside and around the lateral border of the 
scapula, the Circumflex scapular artery emerges at the 
triangular space bordered by the Teres major inferiorly, 
the Teres minor superiorly and the upper triceps laterally. 
(Although sometimes it can be found that this perforator 
exits below the Teres Major) (fig. 5.92)(27,80). The cutane-
ous branches that are mentioned above, vascularize a va-
riety of 4 different flaps all subsidiary from the subscap -
ular system(53). 
Markings
As previously stated, there are 4 possible flaps to be 
designed based on the CSA (fig. 5.94A), though the most

that it is a very constant perforator artery, it can be very pre -

point” localized, the type of flap is selected according to the 
defect location and the required rotation (see fig. 5.93A). 
As stated, the parascapular flap usually does not need to 
exceed 8-9 cm in width, meaning that that primary repair of 
the donor area is feasible. Regarding the vertical dimensions 
of the parascapular flap, its upper boundary is localized on 
the scapular spine. The inferior boundary for island flaps is 
said to be on the inferior angle of the scapula. Although for 
cutaneous pedicled flaps, the inferior limit is extended fur -
ther below this angle. Lateral margins are outlined between 
the mid-axillary line, laterally, and medial vertebral line. It 
should be remembered that the anatomic territory (contrast injected territory) is always less extensive than the surgical 
territory (final vascularized harvested cutaneous territory(71). 
The parascapular flap, based on the triangular space, is out -
lined along the axis of the descending branch of the CSA. 
 Elevation
The flap is raised from distal to proximal, respecting 
the fascia covering the underlying muscles. Some au-
thors recommend a retrograde dissection from the trian -
gular space due to the possibility of an anatomic variation 
about the exit of the descending branch. Figure 5.95. A) According to Serafin (95), the location of the triangular space is at the lateral scapular border, two fifths of the distance inferiorly on 
the line connecting the Acromial process  (AP) and Scapular inferior tip (SIT). B) Outlining of the parascapular flap.

Figure 5.96. Elevation starts by 
incising the skin over the scapu -
lar tip deep into the fascia, which 
is respected. The skin paddle is 
progressively elevated over the 
fascia of the Latissimus Dorsi 
(LD). Elevation continues until 
the upper border of the Latis -
simus Dorsi is reached. If the 
emerging point of the SCA has 
not been previously determined 
by Doppler examination, the 
boundary between Latissimus 
Dorsi and Teres Major has to be 
carefully explored, because of 
the possibility of the previously 
mentioned anomalous emer -
gence between these muscles.

Teres Major (TMj) is reached. Blunt and careful dissection is performed to localize the descending inferior branch of the SCA.

from the surrounding Teres 
muscles deep into the Scapula. 
Minor branches are ligated far 
from the main vessels avoiding 
the use of diathermy. By freeing 
the pedicle from its surround -
ing muscular fibers, the flap will 
be able to rotate like a propeller 
flap.

and its descending branch 
have been isolated all around 
its emergence point, proximal 
skin incision is completed to 
fully liberate the skin island.
Figure 5.101. Deep dissection of the SCA will allow the flap to be rotated to repair defects affecting the axillary area, as well as defects on the Deltoid zone.
Figure 5.102. When rotation is not enough to displace and cover a defect, intermuscular dissection between Teres Major and Minor has to be per -
formed. If the pedicle is found to emerge below the Teres Major muscle, it can be split to gain length for the pedicle.

Trunk148Parascapular-scapular flap options
Parascapular-Scapular pedicled flap: In this case, 
the vessels inside the pedicle do not need to be complete-
ly individualised. It is sufficient to reach the upper border 
of the Teres Major (split or not) and leave all the subcuta -
neous, loose areolar tissue, which goes into the intermus -
cular septum, intact. The looser the areolar tissue, which 
is preserved around the pedicle, the more the pedicle is 
protected and the risk of tilting or torsion is decreased. 
Generally, for the flap to reach the axilla, not very much 
proximal dissection of the pedicle is needed. But as some 
length of the flap is lost by the torsion over its base, the 
flap should be designed to be long enough to over-extend 
its tip further than the inferior angle of the scapula. Oc-
casionally, skin grafts are needed to repair the upper part 
of the donor area on the rotation point. The way to avoid 
skin grafting on this area is the use of the Parascapular 
bilobed flap (which is, in fact the Parascapular-Scapular 
flap) in which the “horizontal” scapular flap constitutes 
the minor arm of the bilobed flap. When the main paras-
capular flap is rotated into the defect, the scapular flap 
will also rotate into the parascapular donor area, while its 
own donor area is repaired by primary closing. 
Parascapular Island flap: Cutaneous paddle is out -
lined following a pattern taken from the defect or as an 
ellipse to facilitate donor area primary repair. The flap is 
elevated as for pedicled flaps, from distal to proximal. 
For island flaps, the pedicle has to be precisely individual -
ized and carefully dissected back through the triangular 
space to gain pedicle length. Donor area for island flap 
is usually repaired by skin grafting. For obese patients, 
the flap is usually thick and too bulky for the axilla. Fur -thermore, a large quantity of skin is needed to repair the 
donor site. That is why the parascapular flap is generally 
the last option to be considered in overweigh or obese 
patients.
Expanded flap: For flaps where the emergence point 
of the main vessel can be precisely determined and its 
surgical territory can also be predicted, the possibility 
of previous expansion can provide many benefits: The 
flap is thinned, its surgical territory enlarged by the delay 
phenomenon and it usually allows for a primary closure. 
However, two surgical stages are required. Pre-transfer 
expansion of the Scapular flap has been reported by Rus-
sell(87), who also emphasised that the inelasticity of the 
transferred cutaneous paddle is detrimental. However, 
tissue expanders can be inserted around and beyond the 
flap’s margins, generally on the lateral thoracic wall or 
medially to the island flap; not to expand the flap itself, 
but to allow for a primary closure of the donor area.
Vascularized bone flap: The scapula is a good source 
for vascularized bone grafts. Though the medial scapu -
la can be transferred, the lateral aspect of the scapula 
is more reliable as it is vascularized by direct branches 
from the Descending osseous branch of the Circumflex 
Scapular artery (see fig. 5.94B)(94). The bone graft can be 
harvested from 2-3 cm below the glenoid fossa up to the 
scapular tip (which should always be preserved to pre-
vent winging of the scapula and preserve function). With 
or without including a cutaneous paddle, to harvest the 
corticocancellous fragment of the lateral scapula, a cuff 
of Teres Major muscle, measuring between 10-12 mm 
has to be left attached to the bone in order to preserve all 
musculoperiosteal vessels entering the bone(104).
