 POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY PERFORATOR FLAP
This is a medium- sized thin flap that is commonly 
harvested as a pedicled flap. It represents one of the 
workhorse flaps for small-medium size defects of the 
lower leg. 
It is supplied by perforator branches from the poste-
rior tibial artery, which communicates and anastomoses 
distally at the malleolar region with the anterior tibial and 
peroneal arteries, creating a rich network of communi -
cating vessels that allow harvesting the flap as a distally 
based flap.
The posterior tibial artery and its perforators have 
been extensively studied and significant differences re-
garding the number of perforators are found between 
different authors. A minimum of 2 to 5 perforators report-
ed by Wu et al.(156), between 2 and 8 by Leong Kim) to a 
maximum of 4 to 9 reported by Tang et al.(142). According 
to Koshima et al.(83) the tibial artery gives off septocuta-
neous, musculocutaneous, and periosteocutaneous per-
forators. It is important to know that this artery may be 
weak or can be congenitally absent(26).
This is a highly versatile flap that can be based on in-
ferior, middle or upper perforators, and can be transferred 
by rotation, V-Y advancement or as a propeller flap. It can 
also be raised as a fasciocutaneous or adipofascial flap, 
or as a composite flap containing a small cuff of muscle, 
bone or tendon. However, harvesting bone from the tibia 
is not a good idea and this version of the flap is very rarely 
used.
As for all perforator flaps, degloving injuries, local 
trauma or burns represent a complete contraindication. 
While relative contraindications may include diabetic and 
obese patients, vein thrombosis, peripheral vascular dis-
eases and heavy smokers. All these factors are indicative 
of serious complications and high-risk flap necrosis.
However, some disadvantages accompany the har-
vesting of this flap, such as, loss of sensation distal to the 
flap and noticeable scars, especially if skin grafts have 
been used to repair the donor area.
Indications
This flap is generally used as a pedicled flap to repair 
minor to medium size full thickness defects of the low-er leg, where tendons, joints or bone are left exposed. 
Though it has also been used as a free flap(79), there are 
numerous perforator flaps with large-diameter vessels 
available.
Depending on which of the perforators is selected, the 
flap can be raised as a proximally or distally based flap to 
repair defects on the proximal, medial or distal aspect of 
the lower leg. 
Vascularization and anatomy
The posterior tibial artery perforator flap is based 
on perforator vessels emerging along the course of 
the posterior tibial artery (7.3-6). It begins at the low -
er border of the popliteus muscle and courses down 
in the deep posterior compartment between the flexor 
digitorum longus and soleus muscle giving off several 
branches. These perforator vessels arise in the inter -
muscular septum between the soleus muscle and flex -
or digitorum longus muscle and/or the medial border 
of the tibia(14) to anastomose superiorly with terminal 
branches from the descending genicular artery and an -
teriorly with terminal branches from the anterior tibial 
artery. Distal perforators are usually larger and these 
are the ones, which are selected to harvest the flap as 
a free flap(66).
According to Shaverian et al.(138) perforator vessels on 
the medial aspect of the leg can be found at a distance of 
about 4 cm -8 cm, 13 cm -17 cm and 21 cm -25 cm from 
the tip of the medial malleolus.
The skin vascularized by these perforators extends 
proximally from the tibial tuberosity and distally to the 
tip of the medial malleolus and, anteriorly from the an -
terior border of the tibia to the posterior midline of the 
calf.
Venous drainage of the flap mainly comes from the 
venae comitantes and secondarily from the superficial 
vein system of the leg, draining at the greater and lesser 
saphenous veins.
Sensory innervation mainly comes from branches of 
the long saphenous nerve while at its posterior aspect, 
cutaneous innervation comes from branches of the sural 
nerve.

Lower Limb340Markings
Two points are first marked out, one proximal on the 
tibial tuberosity and other distally on the tip of the me-
dial malleolus. A line is traced between them. Over this 
line is where the majority of septocutaneous perforators 
from the tibial artery emerge. Depending on which clus -
ter of vessels is intended for use, red crosses are marked 
out over the line at the mentioned distances (about 4-8 
cm, 13-17 cm and 21-25 cm from the tip of the medial 
malleolus). Doppler acoustic assistance rarely localizes 
the exact points of emergence as the nearby presence 
of important arteries makes this type of exploration very 
difficult and inaccurate. However it is generally used as 
assistance.
As in most perforator flaps, external markings are 
approximate references and the final location and shape 
of the skin island is incised only after the best perforator artery has been identified. As in most perforator flaps, it 
is the defect that should adapt to the flap. What happens 
with this flap is that it is highly versatile in location and 
form. The skin island can be outlined as an ellipse, V-Y 
propeller type of flap or as an irregular triangle for V-Y ad -
vancement flap.
Elevation
The skin is incised deep to the fascia, which is left 
included with the flap and only over one of its margins. 
Through this incision the elevation is performed careful-
ly to identify all perforator vessels emerging through the 
septum and entering into the cutaneous paddle. The best 
positioned and largest one is selected. The flap is then 
finally outlined according to the perforator found, and in-
cised.
Figure 7.107. Anatomical relationships for the Posterior tibial artery perforator flap.  Although the nourishing vessel shown here is a septocutaneous 
perforator (4), perforators supplying the flap can  also be  musculocutaneous (traversing the flexor digitorum longus, 5), or a combination of both, 
branching off from the posterior tibial vessels (1). Other references are the soleus muscle (2), the greater saphenous vein and saphenous nerve (3) 
and the Tibialis posterior muscle (6).

Figure 7.111. The centre of the 
defect is established first. Once 
the emergence point of the distal 
perforator (red point) has been 
localized by Doppler examina -
tion, its distance to the central 
aspect of the defect is measured  
(5 cm in this case). The propeller 
flap is outlined measuring the 
arc of rotation (dotted arrow). 
The flap’s rotation or probably a 
minor displacement of the perfo -
rator artery has to be considered, 
and so it is advisable to add 2cm 
more to the proximal part of the 
flap length (5cm+2 cm). 
Figure 7.112. As with most per -
forator flaps, the skin is incised 
on only one of the flap’s borders 
in order to get a clear vision of 
every perforator vessel emerg -
ing from below and entering the 
cutaneous paddle. The incision 
is made deep to the fascia (ar -
rows), which is also incised from 
proximal to distal. 
Figure 7.113. The opening of 
the fascia will leave exposed 
the septum between flexor hal -
lucis longus and soleus muscle 
from where perforator vessels 
arise. All vessels entering the 
cutaneous paddle should ini -
tially be respected. The impor -
tance of incising only one side 
of the flap is that if the best, or 
the sole, perforator is displaced 
from the expected position, the 
cutaneous paddle can be con -
veniently modified.
