215F orearm Radial artery flap. Variations
The Chinese surgeons Yang et al. originally described 
this flap in 1981(79), that is why it has become popularly 
known as the Chinese flap. The flap was later introduced 
into western writing by Song R et al. in 1982(73).
The radial forearm flap represented a revolution, at 
that time, as it was able to transfer a thin and large ex-
tension of skin, based on a single source artery; the radial 
artery. Amongst its advantages are:
• It is a very large and thin flap.
• It can be transferred as a free or rotational flap.
• It can be either elevated proximally or distally.
 However this flap also has some major drawbacks, 
amongst them:
• The sacrifice of the radial artery that usually results in 
loosing certain strength of the forearm muscles and the 
hand becomes intolerant to cold temperatures.
• Profuse hairiness, that can impair aesthetic or functional 
results at the recipient area (i.e. penis-urethra or esopha -
gus reconstruction) 
• Extensive scars of the donor site. (skin grafts directly ap -
plied over the forearm musculature).
Due to the sacrifice of one of the two main arteries 
of the hand, this flap can only be proposed if the ulnar artery is fully competent. It is mandatory to perform 
the Allen test before proceeding with a Radial forearm 
flap.
The Allen test
Even flaps that do not use the main artery could 
challenge the vascular integrity of a previously severely 
injured hand. In cases where the vascularization of the 
hand is in doubt and before planning a flap like this, the 
Allen test must be performed(31) (The Allen test is manda -
tory in radial and ulnar flaps).
Described in 1929, the Allen test consists of the pa-
tient elevating their hand and making a fist, whilst the 
examiner occludes both radial and ulnar arteries. The pa-
tient extends their fingers and blanching of the hand is 
seen. Next, the hand is observed while the radial artery 
alone is released. The same manoeuvre is done with the 
ulnar artery. The colour of the hand should return to nor -
mal immediately after releasing one of these arteries per 
turn. The test is positive when the colour fails to return to 
normal after release of either artery.
Because of the mentioned sacrifice of the radial ar-
tery, two variations of this flap that fully preserve the main 
vessels, (based on perforator branches), have become  FOREARM RADIAL ARTERY FLAP . VARIATIONS

radial and ulnar arteries. B) Patient extends fingers and blanching of the hand is seen. C) Radial artery alone is released and the colour of the hand 
returns to normal. D) Pressing on the radial artery, the ulnar artery is released. If the hand remains blanched, the test is positive, and means that 
vascularization of the hand relies mainly on the radial artery, so it should be left untouched.

the Forearm Radial flap:
• Proximally based Radial forearm flap.
• Distally based Radial forearm flap.
• Proximally based Radial artery perforator flap.
• Distally based Radial perforator flap

FOREARM FLAP
Indications
Due to the previously mentioned drawbacks, this flap 
is essentially used as a free flap when a large area of skin, 
supported by a thin subcutaneous layer, is required. As a pedicle island flap it is indicated for flat defects, affecting 
the elbow region. 
Vascular supply
The Radial artery supplies a territory on the forearm, 
between the elbow and the wrist and the border of the 
ulna (medially), and the forearm dorsal midline (laterally). 
The skin is vascularized through the constant vascular 
subcutaneous anastomosis between three main sep -
tocutaneous branches arising from the main trunk that 
perforate the anterior brachial fascia. The venous return 
is ensured by the venae comitantes. The Cephalic vein 
also plays an important role, especially in distally based 
flaps.
Figure 6.60. A) The radial forearm flap, proximally or distally based is vascularized by the radial artery through its perforator branches vascularizing the 
skin of the anterior forearm. There are three constant arteries nourishing the skin.  B) Distally based radial forearm flap. The pedicle is based on the dis -
tal anastomosis of the radial artery with the ulnar artery through the carpal arches. The pedicle is localized between the tendons of the Flexor carpi radi -
alis and brachioradialis muscles. The shorter is the pedicle the greater is the cutaneous paddle, the longer the pedicle the smaller will be the skin island.

217Markings
Proximally, the radial forearm flap is designed, based 
on references over the wrist. With the wrist bent, the 
Brachioradialis tendon is identified at the lateral (radial) 
aspect of the wrist, while the Flexor carpi radialis tendon 
is seen medially. Between both tendons the Radial artery 
can be palpated (it is accompanied by two venae comi-
tantes) (fig. 6.61 a). Laterally, to the brachioradialis ten-don, over the lateral aspect and dorsum of the wrist, runs 
the superficial branches of the radial nerve and cephalic 
vein (fig. 6.61 b). The boundaries of the flap are the border 
of the ulna laterally, to the midline of the dorsal aspect of 
the forearm. 
However, the greater the flap, the shorter the pedicle. 
An S-shaped or Zig-zag line is outlined on the volar aspect 
of the forearm, to dissect the pedicle proximally.F orearm Radial artery flap. Variations

made (See legends and images below).
