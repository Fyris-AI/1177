241Distally based ulnar artery flap
The ulnar forearm flap was described as a free flap in 
1984(45) and as the radial forearm flap, it provides skin of 
excellent quality. In contrast to the forearm flap, its donor 
site is not so exposed and more acceptable, Additionally,  
the skin paddle is hairless. As is the case with the radial 
forearm flap, the sacrifice of one of the major arteries of 
the hand is required.
To overcome this major drawback compared with 
other flaps, the reverse distally based flap, based on a 
cutaneous perforator branch, was described in 1998(4). It 
does not sacrifice the ulnar artery, but its pedicle is short 
and its indications are limited. As a free flap, this flap has 
a high potential, because it can be transferred as an adi -
pofascial or compound bone flap (ulnar fragment).
Indications
As a pedicled flap, since the pedicle is rather short, 
its range is limited and it is mainly indicated for covering 
defects on the dorsum of the hand and wrist. It can be 
rotated 180º like most of the “propeller” flaps. 
Vascularization
Its blood supply comes from the ascending and de -
scending branches of the Dorsal branch of the ulnar ar-
tery (DBUA), which is also known as the Ulnodorsal artery. 
In the distal third of the of the forearm and proximal to 
the pisiform bone, the Ulnar artery gives off a cutaneous branch, the DBUA, that courses obliquely, from palmar to 
dorsal, passing deep into the Flexor carpi ulnaris. This ar-
tery is closely related to the ulnar nerve (Fig. 6.113) pass -
ing superficially to it and emerging between 2-5 cm(49) or 
2-7 cm(82) proximal to the pisiform bone (The variance in 
measurements depends on different authors).The DBUA 
gives off two branches: 
• Ascending branch of the DBUA that runs between the 
ulna and Flexor carpi radialis, vascularizing the skin of 
the medial side of the lower forearm, and
• Descending branch of the DBUA, which runs between the 
ulnar head and the pisiform bone, accompanying the dorsal 
branch of the ulnar nerve and vascularizing the skin on that 
area. It anastomoses with the dorsal carpal arch and cuta -
neous arterioles from the dorsum of the hand. This network 
of vessels offers the possibility for a variety of flaps.
Markings
The pisiform bone has first to be identified. The pisi -
form bone is the main landmark, while the long axis of the 
flap will be the ulnar bone. The dorsal branch of the ulnar 
nerve will be found at around 2-5 cm (or 7 cm according 
to different authors) proximal to the pisiform bone, over 
the ulnar axis of the flap. From this point, the ascending 
and descending branches can be projected.  The cuta-
neous island paddle, according to different authors can 
measure from 6-16 cm(82) or up to 9-20 cm(49). DISTALLY BASED ULNAR ARTERY FLAP
Figure 6.109. The Pisiform is 
first marked (white cross). The 
axis of the flap is marked be -
tween Flexor carpi ulnaris and 
Extensor carpi ulnaris (dotted 
line). On this line, the emerg -
ing point of the dorsal branch 
of the ulnar artery is found be -
tween 2 and 7 cm, proximal to 
the pisiform point. The cutane -
ous island extends on the dis -
tal third of the forearm. It can 
be about 6-9 cm wide.

Elevation
Raising the flap starts from the radial aspect. The 
skin is incised deep into the fascia, which has to be left included in the flap, exposing the underlying Flexor 
carpi ulnaris (FCU). (Refer to legends under the illus -
trations):

Figure 6.111. As dissection 
proceeds on the ulnar aspect, 
through the transparency 
of the fascia the ascending 
branch can be seen first of 
all (1), later, the descending 
branch and further posteriorly, 
the main pedicle appears (2), 
followed by the dorsal branch 
of the ulnar artery (3).Figure 6.110. A) On its radial 
aspect, the skin is incised deep 
into the fascia. B) The fascia 
has been left attached to the 
flap, while the flexor carpi ul -
naris is shown retracted later -
ally.

Figure 6.113. The DBUA (1) is 
seen entering the subcutane -
ous tissue of the skin paddle, 
while the ulnar nerve (2) is 
seen coursing downward, be -
low the pedicle.
Figure 6.114. Once the DBUA 
and ulnar nerve have been 
identified and isolated, the ul -
nar aspect of the flap is incised 
around the pedicle and the 
island perimeter completely 
freed.
Figure 6.112. Once the dor -
sal branch (1) of the ulnar 
artery (DBUA) has been lo -
calized,emerging between the 
flexor carpi  (3) and extensor 
carpi (2) ulnaris, it has to be 
individualized,  in order to lo -
calize and preserve the ulnar 
nerve that courses immediate -
ly below the DBUA.

flap, it can be mobilized like 
a propeller flap. Its rotation is 
enough to provide coverage for 
wrist or proximal hand defects.
