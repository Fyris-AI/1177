105Pectoralis Major myocutaneous flap
Description of the Pectoralis major flap has to be cred-
ited to Ariyan(9) in 1979, when he demonstrated on fresh 
cadaver dissection, the consistency of a large axial vessel 
branching off the thoraco-acromial artery that coursing 
on its undersurface, vascularized the muscle. Since then 
it has been widely accepted as the option of choice to 
cover defects on the head and neck, anterior chest and 
shoulder(10). It has also been employed as a compound 
flap(59) able to bring bone (either rib or sternum), attached 
to the muscle(48,107).
Though this flap can be elevated in all patients, spe-
cial attention has to be paid to female patients, in order 
to avoid severe breast distortions. Aside from general 
aspects such as local irradiation and general diseases 
or personal habits, particular attention has to be paid to 
those patients with marked chest asymmetry, because 
the possibility of Poland syndrome (congenital absence 
of the pectoralis major muscle). 
Muscle description
The Pectoralis major is a broad, flat, fan-shaped 
muscle covering the upper chest. It originates from the 
medial half of the clavicle and the anterior half of the 
sternum, with several minor insertions to the first seven 
ribs. It inserts into the lateral lip of the bicipital groove 
of the humerus. Its nerve supply comes from the medi -
al and lateral pectoral nerves (direct branches from the 
lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus). These 
nerves enter the muscle with its major vascular pedicle. 
Blood supply comes from a single dominant pedicle, 
the pectoral branch of the thoraco-acromial artery and 
from several minor perforator branches from the inter -
nal mammary artery. This muscle is an adductor and 
medial rotator of the arm, and some degree of disability 
will occur if the muscle is transferred as a flap.
Indications
Pectoralis major flap based on either of its dominant 
pedicles (branches from the thoraco-acromial artery 
or several minor intercostal branches from the internal 
mammary artery have been used to treat defects in quite different regional anatomic areas in the past. Nowadays, 
fasciocutaneous and perforator flaps, either pedicled or 
free, have limited its use as routine procedure. Though it 
can reach different areas and add high vascularized mass 
to a defect, it usually results in a flap that is too thick.
However, given that it is, actually, a versatile flap, it 
can be use for:
• Oropharyngeal defects.
• Mandibular reconstruction.
• Cheek defects.
• Shoulder girdle.
• Anterior chest (cutaneous-sternal defects).
Vascularization
As previously said, this flap has two pedicles. The 
main one comes from branches of the thoraco-acromial 
artery, arising from the subclavian artery. 
Thoraco-acromial branch pedicle: The thoraco-ac -
romial artery is a short anterior branch arising from the 
second part of the axillary artery deep into the Minor 
pectoralis muscle and gives four branches: the pecto -
ral, acromial, clavicular and deltoid. The pectoral branch 
overlaps the Pectoralis minor muscle and gives a small 
branch for it and a larger one that courses down medially 
to supply the Pectoralis major. Their terminal muscular 
perforator branches also supply the breast. Initially, the 
pectoral branch courses downwards somewhat vertical -
ly to adopt an oblique-medial course following the axis 
marked by a line from the acromion-clavicle point to the 
xiphoid. This is the pedicle for a superiorly based Pecto -
ralis major flap.
Segmental intercostal arteries:  From the Internal 
mammary artery, intercostal arteries branched off at 
each of the intercostal spaces to vascularize the integu-
ment of the anterior chest. 
The most important are the 2nd, 3rd and 4th branches, 
but all intercostal vessels, on their way to the subcuta -
neous tissue and breast, give branches that vascularize 
the medial aspect of Pectoralis major muscle and these 
can be used as a pedicle for a medially based Pectoralis 
major muscle flap. PECTORALIS MAJOR MYOCUTANEOUS FLAP

Markings
Outlining of the flap will depend on its use as an island 
rotation flap superiorly based, superiorly based medial 
advancement flap or reverse flap.
Island superiorly based flap: As in every flap, the piv-
ot point has to be established first to calculate the length 
of the pedicle, how the flap will rotate and how the skin 
paddle over the muscle (if needed) has to be designed. 
The thoraco-acromial artery (and vein) emerges at a right 
angle from beneath the middle third of the clavicle cours -
ing downwards first and later following the previously 
mentioned shoulder tip-xiphoid axis. If a cutaneous pad -
dle is needed it is designed accordingly to this axis over 
the muscle.Superiorly based medial advancement flap. This 
usually refers to a muscular flap that is mobilized by an 
advancement-sliding transposition over the sternal region 
with no cutaneous paddle. Only the muscle boundaries 
are marked out as well as the entrance point of the main 
pedicle. Medial incision is determined by the already com -
pleted medial thoracotomy incision or by the wound bor -
der in case of thoracotomy dehiscence. Every muscular 
insertion at the clavicle, rib and humeral groove has to be 
detached to allow an acceptable range of medial displace -
ment. This is the preferred option to treat medial defects 
over the sternum no wider than 10-12 cm. However, mus -
cles should be skin grafted. For very large medial defects, 
the superiorly based muscular flap will allow a better

107transposition and coverage. In the case of large defects, a 
bilateral medial advancement is required. As for all infect -
ed injuries that need debridement, vacuum therapy has to 
be considered before any muscular flap is used. 
Reverse muscular flap. In this case, the muscular 
flap is supplied exclusively from the intercostal perforator 
arteries. The muscle belly has to be completely released 
from its clavicular, humeral and costal insertions. The 
Reverse muscular flap is rarely used as it leaves a bulky 
mass at the level of the hinge, while the lateral aspect of the muscle, which is to be transposed, is the less vascu-
larized portion of the Pectoralis major.
Elevation
The most versatile and reliable procedure is the ro-
tation-transposition based on the main thoraco-acromial 
pectoral branch as a muscular flap, myocutaneous flap 
or osteomyocutaneous flap (which is the one exposed 
here).Pectoralis Major myocutaneous flap
