Figure 6.79. A) Subfascial dissection continues over the Brachioradialis muscle. Any perforator should be properly identified before being divided. 
B) After the radial side of the flap has been completely elevated, the ulnar side of the flap is incised deep into the fascia of the Flexor Carpi Radialis.
Figure 6.80. A) Subfascial dissection is carried out on the Flexor Carpi Radialis until the intermuscular septum, (where the artery and veins run), is 
reached. B) Distal portion of the Radial artery, on the radial side of the FCR tendon is localized by careful dissection with blunt scissors.
Figure 6.81.  A) If the intention is to dissect the RA and veins as far as the snuffbox, they have to be individualised, in order to follow them distally beyond 
the wrist. B) RA and veins are now dissected free from their muscular attachments. Small branches to the surrounding muscles are severed and ligated.

227Distally based radial artery perforator flap 
The popular and reliable radial forearm flap requieres 
the sacrifice of the Radial artery. This is why other flaps 
that avoid the sacrificing of this valuable artery, such as the 
posterior interosseous flap, and the distally based ulnar flap, 
have been described. With the same objective of avoiding the 
sacrifice of the Radial artery(78), another flap was described; 
the reverse forearm pedicled adipofascial flap(12,31,86), which 
can be used for cases where only adipose tissue is needed.
 In addition to the benefit of avoiding the sacrifice of 
the Radial artery, this flap has the advantages of being 
highly reliable and versatile, since it can be used as an 
adipofascial flap(42), fasciocutaneous flap, or neurocuta-
neous flap(4). It does not require microsurgical techniques to be harvested and transferred, and its donor site can be 
primarily repaired depending on the size of the flap.
Indications
This flap is especially useful for coverage of the 
dorsum, wrist, or first web space, as well as for other 
types of defects in the volar or dorsal aspects of the 
hand. However, it is not suitable for more distal defects,  
since the pedicle is rather short. Also, the perforators are 
small and precarious and should not be individualized. 
This flap provides a subcutaneous layer that will allow 
tendons and their sheaths to move freely under it. This  DISTALLY BASED RADIAL ARTERY PERFORATOR FLAP
Figure 6.85. A) Distally based radial forearm fasciocutaneous flap design: A line is traced on the anterior aspect of the wrist over the radial styloid pro -
cess. Over the axis of the radial artery a point is marked at 3-4 cm proximal to the styloid process. Around this point the branching of the distal perforator 
branch of the radial artery can be localized. The skin island is generally placed over the middle third of the forearm. B) The flap is elevated from proximal 
to distal including the fascia of the brachioradialis and flexor carpi radialis muscles taking great care when approaching the emerging point area.

Upper Limb228flap has also been used as a composite flap that is able 
to supply bone, tendon, adipose tissue, fascia and nerve; 
not only for hand defects, but also for nasal reconstruc -
tion(52,42).
Vascularization
The radial artery gives off 12 perforator branches 
along the fascial septum, between the tendons of the Bra-
chioradialis and Flexor Carpi Radialis muscles(83). These 
vessels vascularize the ventral skin and its radial and ul-
nar boundaries. The most distal branch is located 1.5 cm 
above the styloid radial process, where it forms a vascu-
lar network with other perforators. Coming from a distal 
point, it is able to vascularize the area of the descending 
superficial branch of the radial nerve. It can technically be 
classified as a reverse neurocutaneous island flap (83). 
These small skin arteries emerge through the septum 
and form a longitudinally vascular plexus on the deep fas-
cia, as well as in the subcutaneous tissue of the ventral 
aspect of the forearm. The subcutaneous pedicle should 
be 3 cm wide and the pivot point of this flap is 3-4 cm 
proximal to the styloid process of the radial styloid pro-
cess(38). Venous drainage mostly comes from the cephal -
ic vein and other associated veins.Markings
Tendons of the Brachioradialis and the Flexor Carpi 
Radialis muscles are first localized on the wrist (see fig. 
6.61a). The point where the main perforator arises from 
the septum is at 1.5 cm above the styloid process. The 
pivot point of the flap is localized about 3-4 cm proximal 
to the styloid process. A line is traced between this point 
and another, centered on the elbow volar crease. This is 
the axis of the flap. The cutaneous, or adipofascial paddle 
is outlined and centered on the marked axis, around the 
junction of the upper and middle third of the forearm. The 
upper margin of the cutaneous, or adipofascial, island is 
located around 10 cm distal to the elbow, however, its 
distal margin will depend on the length of pedicle need -
ed. The flap’s size determines whether the pedicle will be 
long or short. For larger flaps, the pedicle will be short, 
whereas for smaller flaps the pedicle will be consequently 
longer. The more proximal the skin paddle is raised the 
higher likelihood of necrosis. The flap’s width is around 
5 cm, though wider flaps have been described. Although 
not strictly necessary, it is helpful to localize distal per-
forators by Doppler examination. The boundary between 
the radial artery perforators and the ulnar vascular terri -
tory generally overlies the skin, over the palmaris longus 
muscle.

is marked 3-4 cm proximal to the styloid process.

229Elevation
The procedure starts under controlled ischemia by 
placing a pneumatic tourniquet, or elastic band on the 
upper arm. An S or W-shaped line is outlined and incised from the wrist, over the pedicle to the distal margin of the 
outlined cutaneous island, if it is raised as a cutaneous 
flap, or up to the most proximal point of the flap’s adipo -
fascial paddle, if it is raised as an adipofascial flap.
Figure 6.87. Skin Incision is made in a zig-zag manner to avoid retraction. The adipofascial flap should not be outlined on the proximal third of the 
forearm.
Distally based radial artery perforator flap 
Figure 6.88. For adipofascial flaps, subdermal dissection is performed over the flap’s area, as well as over the pedicle, maintaining a thin layer of fat 
attached to the skin flaps to avoid necrosis or dehiscence of the skin. On the adipose boundaries of the flap the incision is made deep into the fascia, 
which is elevated attached to the flap.

Figure 6.89. The flap is raised including the fascia of the Brachioradialis and Flexor Carpi Radialis, but instead of going deep dissecting the intermus -
cular septum, subfascial dissection proceeds from proximal to distal dividing and ligating the perforators emerging from the radial artery. Close to 
the pivot point (3-4 cm proximal to the styloid process), great care has to be taken to localize and preserve the perforator that vascularize the flap.
