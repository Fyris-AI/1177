195Lateral arm flap
The Lateral arm flap was first described by Song in 
1982(73). Its reliability and constant anatomy encouraged 
more surgeons to explore its anatomy and surgical indi-
cations(17,40,69). Since then, this flap has shown itself as a 
highly versatile flap with many variations for different re-
constructive challenges:
• Adipofascial flap(40). Basically it is the same flap where 
only subcutaneous tissue is preserved. though it can be 
thinned superficially to be adapted to the requirement of 
the recipient site. A flap measuring up to 9 cm by 12 cm 
can be safely elevated(68).
• Musculofascial flap. The close connection, via terminal 
vessels, between the main artery and Triceps muscle, 
enables the flap to be transferred, with a portion of the 
lateral head of the Triceps(32).
• Vascularized Triceps Tendon flap. Musculocutaneous 
perforators from the posterior radial collateral artery, 
that come through the lateral head of the muscle vas -
cularize a segment of Triceps tendon. Harvesting a seg -
ment of the muscle ensures that a segment of Triceps 
tendon, measuring up to 10 cm can be harvested and 
transferred with the flap(1).
• Osteocutaneous flap. The posterior radial collateral ar -
tery gives off one or two periosteal branches to the hu -
merus(33,36,77) at approximately 2 to 7 cm proximal to the 
lateral epicondyle(33). A segment of 10 to 15 cm in length, 
by 1 to 1.5 in width can be harvested over this area and 
used to repair small to medium size defects at the pha -
langes, metacarpals and metatarsals(68), or can even be 
used for mandibular reconstruction(51,77).
• Neurocutaneous sensory flap. The lower lateral cutane -
ous nerve provides sensation to the skin over the lateral 
aspect of the arm and subsequently to the Lateral arm 
flap. It runs subcutaneously and has to be preserved 
when performing the initial subcutaneous incision. A seg -
ment of up to 10cm can be harvested with the flap(11,35).
• Split flap. The cutaneous-subcutaneous paddle of this 
flap is usually nourished by two separated perforators 
that vascularize two different parts of the flap; and as 
long as the main vessel is preserved, both perforators 
and their territories can be split into two and be used to 
repair through-and through defects in the oral cavity(54).When transferred with the posterior cutaneous nerve, 
it will leave an area of hypoesthesia or anesthesia over 
the proximal radial skin in the forearm.
Indications
As a highly versatile flap, it has been widely used. 
For defects on neighbouring areas (axilla, coracoid area, 
elbow, proximal forearm) it can be used as a local ped -
icle perforator flap, distally or proximally based(18,77). As 
mentioned previously, this flap is considered a com -
pound flap that can include: skin, subcutaneous tissue, 
sensitive nerves, muscle, tendon and bone. It can there -
fore be used to repair a great variety of defects at the 
elbow(18,71,77), hand(54,68), forearm(66), face(69), oral cavity and 
tongue(51), ear and nose coverage(11), or to repair limited 
bony defects such as for the hand or mandible. As a 
flap that is capable of transfering a limited segment of 
tendon, it has also been used to repair tendon defects 
at the hand, the Achilles tendon or the Tibialis anterior. 
As an osteocutaneous flap it can be used to repair me -
dium-sized bony defects of the phalanges, metacarpals 
and metatarsals (68).
Vascularization and anatomy
Vascularization of this flap has been extensively stud -
ied and described(7,40,84). The territory where the flap is 
harvested from is vascularized by septal arteries arising 
from the Posterior Radial collateral artery (PRCA), alter-
natively known as Posterior descending branch of the 
Brachial artery (PDBBA).
The PRCA runs within the intermuscular septum, be -
tween the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles anteriorly 
and the triceps brachii muscle posteriorly, and is intimate -
ly attached to the lateral border of the humerus, where it 
gives off periosteal and muscular branches and septocuta -
neous perforators. The most proximal perforator is closely 
related to the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm.
The PRCA courses distally, to anastomose with the 
Radial recurrent artery and posteriorly to the lateral epi-
condyle of the humerus, with the Posterior  interosseous   
recurrent  artery. LATERAL ARM FLAP

## Page 2

Upper Limb196The descending branches from the Brachial artery, the 
Posterior radial collateral artery (PRCA), the Superior and 
Inferior ulnar collateral arteries are those which will finally 
give the branches for the vascular network at the elbow. 
The PRCA with the Radial recurrent artery will be the re -
sponsible for the vascularization of the reverse lateral arm 
flap via the (posterior) Interosseous recurrent artery.
Markings
Two references are first marked out at the acromion 
and the epicondyle. A dotted line is traced between these 
two points, and will correspond to the intermuscular sep-
tum. Lateral to this line lies the axis of the Lateral arm 
flap. The flap is outlined as an ellipse around the central 
axis that represents the lateral intermuscular septum (in which the Posterior radial collateral artery courses). The 
ellipse can be outlined on the distal two thirds of the arm. 
The flap dimension can vary from 8 x 10 cm to 15 x 14 
cm according to Katsaros et all.(40), but if the deep fascial 
plexus is included in the flap, the proximally based lateral 
arm flap can be extended up to 10-12 cm more, over the 
elbow(7).
Elevation
Common to Proximal and Distally based flaps: Sur-
gery is initiated under controlled ischemia with a high po-
sition tourniquet. Elevation of the flap starts with a full 
thickness incision along the posterior border of the flap, 
deepened to expose the triceps. The flap is elevated sub -
fascially until the intermuscular septum (where the PRCA

runs) is reached (Fig. 6.34a). The vascular pedicle is lo-
cated at the deepest part of the septum, very close to the 
humerus bone. Once dissection of the posterior part is 
completed (6.34b), the anterior flap is incised deep into 
the fascia, leaving it attached to the flap and progress-
ing subfascially, until the septum is reached (Fig 6.35a). 
At the anterior aspect of the Septum, the Brachioradialis 
muscle has some insertions that should be carefully di-
vided by sharp dissection to avoid injury to the vascular 
pedicle (Fig. 6.35a). A muscular cuff is better left attached 
to the septum, to ensure proper vascularization, especial-
ly if a bone fragment will be raised with the flap. Once the 
flap has been freed from the intermuscular septum and 
the vascular pedicle is identified, the septum is liberated from the humerus.
For large distally based flaps, it is not necessary to go 
any further proximally, and the pedicle can then be isolat -
ed and ligated on the upper limit of the flap.
For proximally based flaps: From the posterior as -
pect, over the triceps muscle and tendon, dissection 
continues exposing the septum. This plane of dissec -
tion is easier as, unlike the Brachioradialis, there are not 
muscular fibers from the triceps attached to either the 
posterior aspect of the lateral intermuscular septum or 
the deep fascia. Every small vessel has to be careful -
ly coagulated or ligated (Fig. 6.35b). The distal pedicle 
can then be divided, distal to the bifurcation of the radial 
collateral artery, into its posterior and anterior branch -Figure 6.31. Main references 
for the Lateral arm flap: Al -
ternatively, the Acromion (Ac) 
or the most distal point of 
the deltoid insertion (Dt,) can 
be used, both as the upper 
reference. Distal reference is 
marked over the epicondyle 
(Ep). A line is traced between 
both points.
Figure 6.32. At approximately 2 
cm posteriorly to the Dt-Ep line, 
a parallel line is drawn. This line 
represents the position of the 
lateral intermuscular septum 
and the axis of the flap. The skin 
paddle is designed as an ellipse. 
The distal pole is located 1 or 2 
cm proximal to the epicondyle 
and its proximal pole 4-6 cm 
distal to the Deltoid insertion. 
The width of the flap will depend 
on the recipient site’s defect but 
also, if it is intended to primarily 
repair the donor area. Usually 
any flap measuring no more 
than 7 cm width will facilitate 
primary repair.

Upper Limb198es. Proximal dissection continues upwards to obtain a 
longer pedicle if necessary. The radial nerve has to be 
identified, as well as the cutaneous collateral nerve, and 
both are isolated from the pedicle. The radial nerve lies 
anterior to the Posterior radial collateral artery before 
coursing between the brachialis and brachioradialis 
muscles. (Fig. 6.36-37). The Posterior cutaneous nerve 
(PCN) originates from the radial nerve, inferiorly to the 
lower cutaneous nerve within the spiral groove. It pierc -
es the lateral intermuscular septum positioning itself 
anterior to it, running with the RCA before piercing the triceps muscle to reach the skin. Preservation of this 
nerve is important to avoid hypoesthesia or anesthesia 
on the proximal dorsal forearm. The Lower lateral cuta -
neous nerve branching off the radial nerve, proximally 
to the Posterior cutaneous nerve (PCN) within the spiral 
groove, innervates the flap and should be transferred 
with it, if a sensate flap is needed. Once distal branch -
es for muscles are divided (fig. 6.37b) and nerves, es -
pecially the radial nerve, are left well protected, the flap 
is ready to be transposed. A proximal incision can be 
made to facilitate upward  rotation.
Figure 6.34. A) On the anterior aspect of the arm the incision is equally performed deep into the brachial fascia, until the anterior aspect of the inter -
muscular septum is reached. At the anterior-distal aspect of the septum, the Brachioradialis muscle (2) has some insertions that should be carefully 
divided from the humerus bone (1), to avoid injury to the vascular pedicle. A cuff of muscular fibers can be left attached to the septum especially if a 
bone fragment will be harvested with the flap. B) At the posterior aspect of the flap, the Posterior radial collateral artery is localized proximally (arrow).Figure 6.33. Markings. A) Ac: Acromion, Ep: Epicondyle. Dotted line indicates the reference from where the lateral septum of the arm can be local -
ized and where the axis of the flap is marked out. The elliptical cutaneous paddle is outlined over this axis. B) Posterior incision is first performed 
deep into the fascia, which is left included in the flap. Elevation continues up to the base of the intermuscular septum, where perforator vessels are 
seen emerging from the Posterior radial collateral artery. This septum separates the Triceps from the Brachialis muscle.

(PCNF), both are divided and ligated. B) Septum containing the vessels is elevated from distal to proximal and collateral branches from the main 
pedicle to the muscles are carefully identified, divided and ligated. At this stage the radial nerve can be palpated anterior to the septum, between 
the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles.
Figure 6.36. A) Intermuscular septum is strongly attached to the humerus bone. To keep a safe plane of dissection and preserve the PCRA and 
Radial nerve, the flap is elevated strictly at the level of the periostium. B) Proximally, the fascia is gently opened and the radial nerve, covered by 
the brachialis muscle, exposed (yellow arrow). The anterior radial collateral artery that accompanies the radial nerve does not contribute to the 
flap vascularization.

Upper Limb200At this stage, the pedicle (and the nerve) can be divid-
ed if the pedicle is considered long enough. If more length 
for the pedicle is desired, dissection should continue cra-
nially between the lateral and medial head of the Triceps 
muscle, which have to be split, in order to gain access 
to the vessels. Great care has to be taken to identify and 
preserve the motor branches to the Triceps muscle. 
 OSTEOCUTANEOUS FLAP
This flap offers the option to be transferred as an os-
teocutaneous flap. The PRCA not only gives branches to 
the skin through the intermuscular septum, it also gives branches to the humerus. According to Haas et al.(33), one 
or two branches entering the humerus can be found at 2 
cm to 7 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyle. The bone 
segment that is raised with the flap is harvested on that 
area (fig 6.39). Though a muscular cuff from the Brachi-
oradialis and/or Triceps is not strictly necessary due to 
these direct vessels from the PRCA, it can be an advisable 
option(17). The bone segment can measure from 10-15 cm 
in length by 1-1.5 cm in width(68). However, the amount 
of bone to be harvested is limited, because of the poten-
tial risk of stress fracture (Refer to figure 6.39b where the 
length and the sections of bone that can be safely har-
vested are shown).Figure 6.37. A) Dissection is continued proximally and, before the main pedicle is found, the posterior cutaneous nerve (yellow arrow) of the arm is 
seen branching off from the radial nerve (black arrows). B) Once the Radial nerve has been identified, any collateral vessel still branching off from 
the PRCA to the muscles is divided to gain length for the pedicle (1). Distal end of the PRCA is seen over the scissors (2). Red arrows indicate the 
pedicle to the flap. Both the PCRA and the PCN are included.

During its course down to the elbow, the Posterior 
radial collateral artery becomes more superficial and, at 
the epicondylar and olecranon area, its terminal branches 
anastomose with terminal branches from the interosse-
ous recurrent artery, and principally, the radial recurrent arteries (see fig 6.40). This superficial anastomosing 
plexus, that supplies the skin of the elbow and lateral 
forearm, is the basis for the extended lateral arm flap, or 
the distally based lateral arm flap (see below)(7,75). The ex-
tended version of the flap should then include the radial 
recurrent artery.

The flap can be extended over an axis traced between 
the lateral epicondyle and styloid process. The skin area 
can measure up to 12-16 cm distal, to the lateral epicon-
dyle, over the proximal radial region of the forearm(59). The 
width will depend, however, on the defect’s needs and the 
possibility of a primary repair of the donor area.
The flap can be raised in continuity, as a single unit: 
classical lateral arm skin paddle, plus proximal radi -
al forearm skin, or as a distant posterolateral forearm 
cutaneous flap (reverse distal arm flap will be treated 
later).As an extended flap, the lateral arm flap is first har-
vested, identifying and raising the intermuscular septum, 
the PRCA and the PCN, stopping dissection over the el-
bow. The forearm cutaneous extension of the flap is then 
raised. Though it is not strictly necessary to raise the flap 
subfascially, elevating the fascia with the flap is highly ad -
visable, as the deep fascial plexus is then better respect -
ed and protected. However, this option not only adds up 
to 12 cm of forearm skin to the classical lateral arm flap, 
(according to Brandt(7), the flap itself is thin, elastic and 
sensitive if it is transferred with the PCN.
