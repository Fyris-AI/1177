371Dorsalis pedis cutaneous perforator flap
 DORSALIS PEDIS CUTANEOUS PERFORATOR FLAP
The Dorsalis pedis cutaneous flap is one of the ear-
liest neurovascular flaps to be described; as its origins 
can be traced as far back as 1897 and 1900 when the 
Austrian surgeon Carl Nicoladoni described his proce-
dure to transfer a toe to the hand to reconstruct a lost 
thumb(117,118). Handicaps and complications derived from 
attempting to immobilize the hand attached to the foot 
caused the procedure to be abandoned.
In 1973 Oâ€™Brien and Shanmugan(121) suggested the 
possibility of raising a free flap based on the Dorsalis pedis 
artery. In 1975, McGraw and Furlow(106) described the Dor -
salis pedis arterialized flap. Further studies about macro 
and microcirculation of the Dorsalis pedis artery(90,94) aided 
the description of the dorsalis pedis artery angiosome that 
includes the entire dorsal aspect of the foot with tendons, 
muscle (extensor digitorum brevis) and bone (metatarsal 
bones) supplied by the medial tarsal, lateral tarsal, arcu -
ate and dorsal metatarsal arteries. This angiosome facil -
itated the development of a panoply of flaps and thumb 
reconstruction by means of toe transplants based on the 
Dorsalis pedis artery. This flap has the advantage of being 
capable of transferring thin pliable skin and subcutaneous 
tissue, even in overweight patients.
Since its description, this flap has been widely used 
as a proximal pedicled flap, distally based flap, free flap 
or composite flap containing tendons, muscle or bone.
This is a difficult flap to elevate and potential prob-
lems at the donor site should be taken into consideration, 
as they are not insignificant. Specifically, failure to pre-
serve the paratenon layer will lead to poor healing of the 
donor site.
Indications
Indications for this type of flap are multiple and main-
ly depend on whether the flap is elevated as a pedicled 
flap or free flap. As a pure cutaneous flap or muscular 
(extensor digitorum brevis) flap(85, 89), the flap has been 
described to repair dorsum defects of the foot (Lai)(87), 
heel defects or distal foot defects(53,68). As a free flap it 
has been extensively used to repair soft tissue defects on 
the head and neck area(11,36,166) as well as to repair bone 
defects of the mandible(167), the hand, and digits(69,104).Vascularization and anatomy
The Tibialis anterior artery, at the level of the ankle, 
takes the name of the Dorsalis pedis artery. It courses dis -
tally lateral to the extensor hallucis longus and medially to 
the tendon of the extensor digitorum longus and the me -
dial terminal branch of the deep peroneal nerve. Above the 
tarsus it gives off a lateral branch: the lateral tarsal artery, 
which passes deep to the extensor digitorum brevis and 
supplies this muscle, and the arcuate artery from where 
the second, third and fourth metatarsal arteries emerge. 
Finally, the Dorsalis pedis artery reaches the first inter -
metatarsal space and divides into two terminal branch -
es, the first dorsal metatarsal artery and the deep plantar 
artery. The first dorsal metatarsal artery courses forward 
towards the first web space above the deep transverse 
metatarsal ligament to give three terminal branches. One 
branch courses on the dorso-lateral aspect of the great 
toe, another on the dorsal aspect of the medial side of the 
second toe and the third acts as a communicating branch 
with the first plantar metatarsal artery.
Markings
Routine angiography and/or Doppler examination are 
not necessary if adequate independent dorsalis pedis 
and posterior tibial pulse are present. The flap is outlined 
centered on the second metatarsal. The proximal bound-
ary is over the extensor retinaculum while the distal one 
is proximal to the interdigital web spaces. Laterally it can 
be extended up to 1 cm from the extensor digiti quinti 
and medially up to 1 cm from the extensor longus ten-
don. Proximal to the skin paddle a longitudinal incision 
is made over the axis of the flap to facilitate access to 
the vascular, nerves and tendinous structures supplying 
or traversing the flap. When a superficial dorsal interme -
tatarsal artery is present (Doppler assistance is then nec-
essary) the cutaneous island of the flap can be extended 
distally to the base of the toes.
The Dorsalis pedis cutaneous perforator flap can be 
raised proximally or distally based, depending on where 
the defect is. If it is intended to cover medial or lateral 
ankle defects, the flap is best harvested proximally based. 
The flap can also be raised as a free flap to repair distal

a donor site is done depending on the recipient area and 
recipient vessels. It seems that for hypopharyngeal, man-
dibular or floor of the mouth defects, it is better to select 
the contralateral foot(167).
Elevation
Elevation starts by doing a small incision proximal to 
the cutaneous island to identify and preserve the vascular 
pedicle, the internal saphenous vein and the superficial 
peroneal nerve. Only after all these important structures 
have been identified, can the skin paddle be elevated from medial to lateral. To keep the vascular pedicle properly 
connected with the skin paddle it is usually necessary to 
divide the tendon of the extensor hallucis brevis muscle. 
It is extremely important to preserve the paratenon of all 
exposed tendons, as well as all areolar tissue exposed, to 
leave a reliable layer to the skin grafts.
It is a thin, sensitive and pliable flap, which is easy to 
adapt to proximal defects of the foot and distal third of 
the leg, as well as for defects around the mouth and neck.
However, it is also a difficult flap to elevate because 
the tissue connecting the artery with the skin is very thin, 
even in overweight patients. And the resulting defect at 
the donor area may be aesthetic and functionally limited.Figure 7.164. Dorsalis pedis skin flap main vascular and anatomical references.

Donor area aftercare
The resulting scar and deformity in the donor area is 
one of the main setbacks of this flap. Donor-site healing 
complications will invariably occur if vascularized paraten -
on has not been preserved. The donor area is best repaired with split-thickness skin grafts covered by a bolus dressing.
The patient should lie in bed with the foot elevated, 
with bed rest for at least 10 days, avoiding movements. 
The ankle and foot are maintained in neutral position with 
a posterior splint.Figure 7.173. A) With the artery isolated, the flap is detached laterally. Lateral elevation should be performed carefully to preserve the paratenon, (the 
loose and well-vascularized areolar tissue covering the extensor tendons.) This tissue will provide a suitable bed for split-thickness skin grafting.  Inju -
ries, lacerations or accidental tears to this layer, if not properly repaired, will result in poor healing with important aesthetic and functional impairment 
of the donor area.
