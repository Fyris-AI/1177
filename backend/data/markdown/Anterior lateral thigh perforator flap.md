 ANTERO-LATERAL THIGH FLAP
Described by Song et al.(184) in 1984 as the septocutane-
ous perforator flap, it was later questioned, and anatomic vari-
ations were clarified by anatomic studies; resulting in 40,8% 
for septocutaneous vessels and 59% for musculocutaneous 
perforators(78,158). This flap is one of the most commonly used 
for a great variety of defects of the head, neck, oral cavity, 
oesophagus, upper and lower extremity, groin and abdomi-
nal wall and because of its possible combinations(82,83). It is 
a highly reliable, constant, versatile, relatively easy to dissect, 
thin flap, which, if it is not wider than 7-8 cm, it will allow for a 
donor area primary closure with minor donor site morbidity.
Indications
As a free flap, it can be used for covering defects all 
over the body as has already been described. As a perfo -
rator pedicled flap, and depending of the pedicleâ€™s length it 
can cover defects at the perineal-groin area (short pedicle) 
or abdominal or iliac crest zone (long pedicle) (fig. 7.16).
Anatomy and vascularization
The Lateral Circumflex Femoral artery (LCFA) (fig. 7.1-
9) arises from the Deep Femoral artery (DFA) deep to the 
Rectus Femoris and Sartorious muscles giving off three 
branches: the Ascending branch (AB), the Transverse Branch (TB) and the Descending Branch (DB) (fig. 7.1-10, 
11 and 13). This branch, the DB, courses caudally on the 
medial aspect of the Vastus Lateralis or occasionally ov 
erlying the Vastus intermedius muscle(96). The DB of the 
LCFA gives off several branches over the line that goes 
from the anterior superior iliac spine to the lateral superi -
or corner of the patella. Some of these branches are mus -
cle perforators while others emerge as septal perforators.
Markings
Outlining the flap starts by localizing the perforator 
branches that will finally vascularize the flap. First, the 
superior iliac spine and the proximal lateral corner of the 
patella are marked out. A line is drawn uniting both ref-
erence points. At midpoint of the line a circumference, 3 
cm in diameter is outlined. Usually perforators emerge 
at the inferolateral quadrant. When possible, Doppler ex-
amination will add accuracy to perforator location. Once 
located, an elliptical cutaneous island is outlined around 
the localized perforators.
Elevation
Flap elevation steps are described below on a fresh 
cadaver dissection.
Figure 7.8. An elliptical cutane -
ous island is outlined around 
the localized perforator vessels. 
However Doppler examination 
greatly helps to localize the 
points where vessels pierce the 
fascia and emerge to the skin.

Lower Limb278Figure 7.9. Flap elevation starts 
by incising the medial edge of 
the cutaneous island until the 
fascia is reached. Dissection 
is continued over the fascia, 
until the Lateral femoral cuta -
neous nerve is identified and 
preserved.
Figure 7.10. Dissection is con -
tinued and every musculocuta -
neous perforator near the sep -
tum is isolated and respected.
Figure 5.11. Fascia is incised 
medially to the perforator ves -
sels and the muscle is exposed 
from proximal to distal.

Figure 7.12. If the main perfora -
tor vessel is septal, the Descend -
ing Branch of the LCFA is local -
ized at the base of the septum. 
If vessels emerge through t he 
muscle it has to be opened to 
expose the vessels in length un -
til the DB of the LCFA is found. 
Muscle should not be spared in 
order to protect the pedicle.
Figure 7.13. Muscle is opened 
as much as necessary to indi -
vidualize the pedicle proximally. 
If needed, dissection is contin -
ued upward to gain length for 
the pedicle.
Figure 5.14. On the lateral side, 
incision is made deep to the fas -
cia and dissection is carried out 
over the fascia until the septum 
is reached. Great care has to be 
taken with musculocutaneous 
perforators emerging from the 
septum.
