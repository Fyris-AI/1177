73Lip switch flap (Abbe flap).
Originally described by Stein in 1848(30), the lip 
switch flap was later popularized by Abbe(1) who gave 
the name to the switch flap. Though many flaps have 
been described which can repair an upper lip or a com -
missure, this is the most reliable, practical, and versa -
tile flap. Estlander described a similar flap including the 
oral commissure in 1872(13). That is why when the Abbe 
flap includes the commissure, it is also known as the 
Abbe-Estlander flap. Up to half the inferior lip can be 
harvested to repair the upper lip, though ideally the flap 
should be about one third the size of the inferior lip.
Although it cannot be considered to be an Abbe flap, 
the inferior labial artery is also the supply vessel for other 
types of flaps. As long as the labial artery is preserved, 
mucosal or vermillion flaps can also be harvested from 
the inferior lip, unilaterally or bilaterally based (inferior la-
bial artery bi-pedicled vermillion flap).
This flap is a cross flap and will invariably need a sec-
ond stage to divide the pedicle and remodel the donor 
area if needed (usually 3 weeks later).
Indications
This flap is mainly indicated to repair defects affect-
ing the upper lip or buccal commissures. Partial or minor 
forms of Abbe flap can be considered to repair vermillion defects that are secondary to poor cleft lip repair, where 
only part of the prolabium or partial vermillion loss re-
sults.
Vascularization
This flap is based on the inferior labial artery that 
emerges at the edge of the commissure, as a collateral 
branch from the facial artery (see inferior labial artery). It 
courses medially from one side to anastomose with its 
counterpart on the upper-inner aspect of the vermillion 
(see Fig. 4.32) supplying the inferior lip.
Markings
The precise boundaries of the defect on the upper lip 
have to be established. If possible, these limits should 
be accommodated to the standard aesthetic units and 
subunits of the upper lip, cheek and nose; in order to 
place the scars at the boundaries of these units. Once 
the precise limits of the defect are established, a pattern 
is taken and transposed to the lower lip to obtain a flap 
that, once rotated, fits perfectly into the defect. It is also 
very important that the donor area can be repaired avoid -
ing secondary deformation of the remaining lip and the 
mental area. 
Figure 4.48. A) Generally, a pat -
tern from the defect should be 
obtained to outline the shape 
and size of the flap on the 
lower lip. The forked design 
shown here is the one that will 
facilitate the closure of the do -
nor area with the best-placed 
scars. B) Position of the inferior

Head74Figure 4.49. A) The incision starts at full thickness, on the distal aspect of the vermillion. By doing so, the position of the inferior labial artery is 
revealed. The artery is divided and ligated. B) The lip is incised deep through the orbicularis muscle, including the mucosa.
Figure 4.50. A) The mucosa from the vestibular side is also incised according to the size and shape of the defect. B) If no special shape is needed, a 
V-shape incision will ensure proper repair to the donor area. Vestibular incision on the pedicle side should stop 5-10 mms inferior to the vermillion and 
should never be made deep, in order to avoid injuries to the main vessel.

AWhatever the shape of the flap that is outlined, a “ver-
million bridge”, including the artery has to be preserved.
The Abbe flap can be harvested laterally based (Fig 
4.33) or medially based (Fig. 4.37) depending whether the 
pedicle will be left on the lateral aspect of the flap or the 
medial aspect.
Depending on the position of the flap and its pedicle, 
the mouth will remain nearly closed during the next three 
weeks or can remain practically unrestricted. Flaps based 
on a medial pedicle that are harvested from the side of 
the lower lip, will allow the patient to open the mouth to 
almost 100% (see 4.37b).Elevation
Elevation of this flap is not complicated but some surgi -
cal details are important, to ensure a safe elevation-rotation.
Insetting the flap
The pivot point has to be secured with two or three skin 
sutures to avoid accidental stretching or avulsion of the 
pedicle. The donor area is sutured in separate layers: mu -
cosa first, the muscle after, and finally the skin. The same 
order is followed in the recipient area with the flap. Other 
defects can then be repaired with local flaps or skin grafts.

Figure 4.51. A) On the proximal aspect, incision is also performed at full thickness, including skin and muscle over the chin and vestibular mucosal. 
Once close to the vermillion it should stop. B) Mental branch of the inferior alveolar artery can usually be seen at the middle aspect of the flap. As 
they are not part of the pedicle they can be divided.

Figure 4.52. A) Occasionally the flap fits and rotates better if few mm of mucosa over the vermillion are incised. It has to be done very carefully 
to avoid injury to superficial anterior branches supplying the flap. B) Upward rotation is easily obtained while primary closure of the donor area is 
performed, with none or minimal post-operative deformities.
