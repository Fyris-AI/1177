45STA Galea Pedicled Flap
This flap is a highly versatile flap that can be trans-
ferred, based on the superficial temporal artery or one of 
its branches. The superficial temporal artery can be pal-
pated, and assistance from acoustic devices (Doppler) is 
rarely needed. The key point for superficial temporal ar-
tery flaps is the galea aponeurotica.
The superficial temporal artery is the base for a great 
variety of flaps; either pedicled or free(16), to provide cov-
ering for reconstructed tendons(32), bony structures(20), or 
cartilages(6), as filler for wrist ankylosis treatment(3), to 
provide a gliding surface for tendons(4), to transfer hair 
bearing skin(11), or transfer split thickness(18) or full thick-
ness parietal bone(20). The auricular branch acts as a vas-
cular bridge between the superficial temporal artery sys -
tem and the posterior auricular artery, to act as a pedicle 
for the Washio flap(33).
Though not mandatory, surgery will be facilitated if 
the scalp is shaved beforehand, when treating fistula or 
exposed bone fragments.
Raising any type of galea flaps, even when hair folli-
cles have not been injured will cause edema and swelling 
of the subcutaneous tissue where the hair follicles are 
located. It will provoke temporary hair loss and alopecia. 
However, hair is restored after 4-6 weeks, so patients 
should be advised of this.Indications
As a cutaneous flap, this flap has been used to bring a 
limited hair bearing skin island to the face (complete up-
per lip reconstruction in male patients). Though in these 
cases, the flap should be delayed to ensure safe vascu-
larization. Small cutaneous hair bearing flaps have been 
used in the past to reconstruct eyebrows lost by burns. 
The main usefulness of this flap is to act as a barrier or 
protective layer for covering noble structures in the face 
or in the skull, acting as a layer for grafts or as a vascu-
larized filler in the orbit or through the temporalis fossa 
in the palate in cases where huge fistulas cannot be cov-
ered by conventional flaps.
Anatomy
The Galea is a thin a pliable layer of tissue under 
the scalp, the thinnest structure that can be transferred 
with its own vascular supply in the body. It is located 
between the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and the 
temporalis fascia (at the temporal region) and peric -
ranium above the temporalis line (Fig. 4.5). Anteriorly 
it limits with the Frontalis muscle, posteriorly with the 
occipital muscle, inferiorly with the SMASS (superficial 
musculoaponeurotic system) and superiorly with the

Head46medial pericranium(31). The Galea can be differentiated 
into three zones: the lowest or Temporoparietal fascia 
(which is richly vascularized), the Galea aponeurotica 
above the temporal line (which is well vascularized) and 
the pericranium (which is poorly vascularized by termi -
nal branches). In addition, the scalp is inelastic, the ga -
lea aponeurotica is poorly elastic and the pericranium is 
nondistensible.
Vascularization
The Galea is vascularized by the temporal artery; 
a distal branch of the external carotid artery (Gig. 4.4-
7). It usually extends from the frontal bone anteriorly 
to the occipital fascia, posteriorly on each side. Once 
inside the galea, the superficial temporal artery gives 
two main branches, the anterior (or frontal branch) 
and the posterior (or parietal branch) and a minor one, 
the auricular branch. All anastomose to create a rich network of vessels. Terminal cutaneous branches of 
these vessels vascularize the scalp as well as parietal 
bones.
Markings
The origin of the STA can be easily determined 
without Doppler or the assistance of acoustic devices. 
As the origin of the artery and its branches are always 
constant, the flap does not need a very precise outlin -
ing, especially if the flap is broad and includes both 
branches. 
The flap does not need to be outlined over a shaved 
scalp. In fact the scalp is rarely shaved, but it is the in -
cision that needs to be strategically placed, to facilitate 
undermining of the galea from the skin from a comfort -
able position, but especially to avoid, as far as possible, 
leaving the incision over an area where a craniotomy 
has been made.Figure 4.6. Broad galea flap

Elevation
Flap elevation usually requires a bi-coronal approach, 
although previous incisions or debridement margins 
can be used if they provide a good exposure. The coro -nal incision can be done over the outlined galeal flap, al -
though if possible, it is better to place it on the anterior or 
posterior border of the flap. When the incision is planned 

## Page 4

Head48outside the flap boundaries, the scalp is not incised fully 
deep to the pericranium, it is always better to respect a 
strip of galea that will later facilitate two-layer closure at 
the end. Elevation starts with incising the galea on one 
of the flap’s margins, firstly elevating the cutaneous flap 
from the galea. By doing this first, the galea will remain 
attached to the periostium and dissection from the sub -
cutaneous tissue will be facilitated. The scalp is pulled 
tight and folded, and the galea individualized by using 
the knife (never the cautery) taking care not to go too 
deep and compromise the galea vascularization or too superficially and destroy the hair follicles. Although the 
galea is easily identified, it is not so easily individualized 
from the scalp since there is not a surgical plane for dis -
section, and the space between the scalp and galea is 
almost inexistent. An excellent reference for being on 
the right plane of elevation is the bottom of the hair fol -
licles (Figs. 4.5 and 4.18). They should be seen on the 
scalp flap but never incised. Galea individualization in 
bald patients is more difficult as the scalp is thinner in 
these patients. However, there is no risk for post-opera -
tive alopecia.

Figure 4.9. The scalp is firmly 
attached to the galea by fi -
brous connections - nerves 
and terminal vessels emerging 
from the superficial temporal 
artery (STA) branches. Eleva -
tion is tedious and time con -
suming and can be performed 
with either knife or scissors. 
Fibrous attachments have to 
be divided without injuring the 
vessels below (galea) and hair 
bulbs above (subcutaneous 
tissue of the scalp).
