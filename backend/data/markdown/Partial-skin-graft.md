51STA Galea Pedicled Flap
Figure 4.15. Once the flap has 
been completely incised it is 
then detached from the perios -
tium distally and the tempora -
lis fascia proximally. Elevation 
is easy and quick compared 
with dissection from the scalp. 
However, temporal vessels in -
cluded into the galea should 
not be injured. Small perfora -
tor branches vascularizing the 
cranial vault are divided, while 
major branches are divided 
and ligated.

53STA Composite bone flap
Raising an osteo-galeal flap in practical terms means 
that a craniotomy has to be performed. When planning a 
monocortical (outer table) osteo-galeal flap, always con-
sider the possibility of entering or damaging the inner ta-
ble as well as damaging the dura. Raising of an osteo-ga-
leal flap should not be attempted if not familiar with the 
management of craniotomies.
The scalp is partially or completely shaved to facili-
tate surgical manipulation, especially if fistulas or full 
thickness defects are present. The real size of the cal-
varia defect has to be determined first, as the real defect 
can be larger than externally suspected (due to necrosis, 
osteomyelitis, etc.). Simple X-rays can give enough infor -
mation about the state of the bone and the extension of 
the real defect to be removed. Once the real size of the 
defect has been established, the size of the galea flap is 
outlined to see if it can effectively fit to gently cover the 
defect. The galea should always be larger than the defect 
that it is supposed to cover.
Indications
This composite flap has been successfully used in 
many situations where a bone defect is present in the 
skull or face(20):
• Large fragments of vascularized parietal bone can be 
used to repair defects such as large as hemi-mandib -
ulectomies. The major setback for this type of recon -
struction is that the surgeon must be familiar with crani -
otomies and that dental implants can be difficult to use 
because the limited width of the parietal bone.
• To add bony mass (and volume) or to restore zygomat -
ic bone defects as in craniofacial clefts, especially in 
severe cases of Treacher-Collins syndrome and other 
types of clefts affecting the midface.
• Transfer of healthy vascularized bone where cranioplas -
ties have failed after neurosurgical procedures.
Vascularization
See above (galea pedicled flap).Markings
The area of the final bone defect to be removed is out -
lined on the scalp as a reference and later, on the exposed 
galea. The superficial temporal artery is palpated over the 
preauricular and temporal area and marked as reference, 
and the galea flap outlined over the scalp into its territory 
(anterior, medial, or posterior).
Elevation
Individualization of the galea from the scalp is carried 
out as explained above, though in this case, when a bone 
fragment will be left attached and elevated with the galea, 
elevation stops slightly beyond the limits of the outlined 
bone fragment (fig. 4.9a). Galea should always be left at -
tached to the bone (generally parietal bone) to preserve 
its vascularization from the terminal branches of the su -
perficial temporal artery. For split thickness bone grafts, 
osteotomies are initiated by drilling on the outlined limits 
of the selected piece of bone, until the diploe is reached 
(Fig. 4.9b). It is easy to recognize the right plane because 
as soon as the diploe is reached it starts bleeding. The 
bone can be completely detached with a curved chis -
el. This is not an easy task and very often the inner ta -
ble is penetrated during the manoeuvre; especially if the 
fragment is large. If the decision is made to elevate a full 
thickness bone graft, craniotomies are performed at each 
of the bone fragment’s corners and connected by osteoto -
mies with a Gigli saw or powered instruments. Great care 
should be taken when using powered instruments close to 
the galea, as it can be easily stripped away and detached 
from the bone. The bone under the pedicle is cut with a 
Gigli saw (Fig. 4.10a) thus allowing complete elevation of 
a full thickness parietal bone graft, which is well connect -
ed and vascularized to its arterial pedicle (Fig. 4.10b).
However, osteo-galeal flaps remain the ideal option 
when osteomyelitis is or was present and for localized 
cranial vault defects where the use of alloplastic materi-
als cannot be considered. SUPERFICIAL TEMPORAL ARTERY COMPOSITE BONE FLAP

required parietal bone fragment 
(outlined) has been individual -
ized from the scalp (which can 
be seen in the upper part folded 
down over the face) and pedicled 
on the right superficial temporal 
vessels. Galea tissue should al -
ways exceed the bone fragment 
boundaries. B) The limits of 
the bone graft are burred to the 
diploe for split-thickness bone 
graft or to the dura for full-thick -
ness grafts. Great care has to be 
taken when using powered de -
vices close to the galea as it can 
very easily detach the pedicle 
from the bone fragment.
Figure 4.20. A) While osteoto -
mies around the bone fragment 
can be done with powered de -
vices, the osteotomy under the 
pedicle is always performed 
with a Gigli saw. It has to be 
gently and carefully done as 
saw movements could easi -
ly damage the pedicle. B) Full
