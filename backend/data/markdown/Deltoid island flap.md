183Deltoid island flap
The Deltoid flap was initially described by Franklin in 
1984(27) as a free fasciocutaneous flap, based on the pos-
terior deltoid subcutaneous artery. 
As the deltoid muscle is not an expandable one, it 
should never be entirely included in a myocutaneous 
flap. However, as full muscle flap, it has been success -
fully used in upper arm amputations(60). As a flap it can 
be used if only one part of it is mobilized (either anterior 
or posterior), as long as vascularization and innerva -
tion is preserved for the muscle that has been left in 
place(56).
Indications
It will depend on how this flap is elevated, as it can be 
used as a split myocutaneous pedicled flap, a fasciocu -
taneous perforator pedicled flap or a free perforator flap. 
As a myocutaneous flap, and due to its very important 
function as arm abductor, it has been used for upper arm 
amputations(60). Or, by splitting the muscle into two parts, 
and using exclusively only one of them, it can be used 
to treat local deep defects (radionecrotic ulcers)(56), or as 
an orthopaedic procedure for rotator cuff tears of the el-
bow(2,21). As a fasciocutaneous perforator flap it can be 
used to cover neighbouring defects around the acromion 
and either anterior, or posterior axillary folds. As a free 
flap it has been used to repair a great variety of defects; 
from the lower extremity to the penis(34, 57, 65). The flap is 
highly reliable as its pedicle is, but the unsightly donor 
site scar, which is prone to becoming hypertrophic or the 
highly visible defect when donor site is repaired by skin grafting, are all factors that prevent this flap from being 
a first option.
Vascularization and anatomy
The Deltoid muscle has two origins; the posterior part 
on the acromial process and the anterior part on the clavi-
cle. It inserts at the deltoid tuberosity at the mid humerus. 
Two branches from the axillary nerve innervate the mus -
cle; the anterior branch supplies the anterior part of the 
muscle, while the posterior branch supplies the posterior 
part(56).
The Deltoid muscle is vascularized by three main 
vessels, the Posterior circumflex humeral artery (PCHA), 
Anterior circumflex humeral artery (ACHA) and termi -
nal branches (deltoid branches) of the Acromiothoracic 
artery. A Deltoid flap is based on a constant perforator 
branch, the Posterior subcutaneous deltoid artery. This is 
a well-known artery described by Manchot(47) that branch-
es off from the PCHA. This artery surrounds the neck 
of the humerus and emerges through the quadrangular 
space delimitated by the Teres Major superiorly, Teres 
minor inferiorly, Long head of the Triceps Brachii medially 
and lateral head of the Triceps brachii laterally. It supplies 
the shoulder joint, Teres major and Teres minor, the long 
and lateral head of the Triceps, Deltoid muscle and the 
posterior-lateral aspect of the skin over the shoulder (see 
6.9). PCHA anastomoses with the ACHA and the acromi-
al and deltoid branches of the thoraco-acromial system. 
The Deltoid flap, as a perforator flap, can also be supplied 
by perforator vessels from the PCHA. DEL TOID ISLAND FLAP

Markings
To localize the area where the nourishing vessels of 
the flap may emerge (Posterior subcutaneous deltoid ar-
tery or perforator branch from the Posterior circumflex 
humeral artery), a point (Ec) is marked out over the me-
dial epicondyle and another over the tip of the acromion 
(Ac). A line is traced between these two points. Posterior 
border of the Deltoid muscle should be localized and a line is drawn over it. The crossing point of these two lines 
indicates approximately the emergence point of perfora-
tor vessels. The Posterior subcutaneous deltoid artery 
courses between the lateral head of the Triceps and the 
posterior border of the Deltoid muscle (PBD), consequent -
ly, the posterior limit of the flap is always drawn posteri -
orly to this border. The anterior limit of the flap should 
always be anterior to the perforator emerging point (EP).
Figure 6.10. Acromial point 
(Ac) and Epicondyle point (Ec) 
are marked and a straight line 
drawn between them. Posteri -
or border of the Deltoid muscle 
is outlined. The crossing point 
between both lines represents 
the area where the perforator 
vessel may emerge. However, 
previous Doppler examination 
will help with localizing emer -
gence points of different perfo -
rator arteries (EP).

Figure 6.11. Cutaneous pad -
dle is elevated from proximal 
to distal in a subfascial plane. 
However, great care has to 
be taken when elevating the 
flap on the posterior border 
of the Deltoid muscle, as it is 
there where the posterior del -
toid subcutaneous artery can 
emerge. If it is decided to base 
the flap on a perforator vessel, 
dissection is continued.
Figure 6.12. Harvesting the 
flap below the fascia will help 
both in localizing the select -
ed perforator and splitting the 
muscle to dissect the vessels. 
Posterior border of the skin 
paddle is not incised, until a 
reliable perforator is safely 
isolated.
Figure 6.13. Muscle bundles 
and fibers are gentle split lon -
gitudinally to get access to the 
perforator vessel.

Upper Limb186Figure 6.14. No muscle fibers 
are spared to dissect the per -
forator vessel into the muscle 
and get extra length for the 
pedicle. Muscle bundles are 
opened as much as necessary.
Figure 6.15. In this case the 
perforator vessel is seen prob -
ably coming from the anterior 
circumflex humeral artery at 
the anterior portion of the Del -
toid.
Figure 6.16. Once the vessels 
have been completely isolated 
at the desired length, the cu -
taneous paddle is completely 
incised and elevated.

it can easily reach the anteri -

around the acromion.
