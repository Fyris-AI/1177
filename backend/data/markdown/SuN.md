 DISTALLY BASED SURAL ARTERY NEUROCUTANEOUS FLAP
The distally based Sural flap was first described by 
Donski and Fogdestam in 1983(30) and later popularized 
by Masquelet et al.(102). It is a neurocutaneous flap, which 
means that the vessel accompanying a cutaneous sen-
sitive nerve, the sural nerve in this case, supplies the 
skin paddle of the flap. This type of vascularization was 
already suggested by Salmon in 1936(129), and Quenu 
and Lejars(127) in 1892. Different authors later stated that 
vessels accompanying cutaneous nerves, routinely pen-
etrate the deep fascia and/or pierce it(13) while also tra-
versing  adipose tissue(115).These types of flaps were then 
named “Neurocutaneous perforator flaps” or “Venoneuro-
adipofascial flaps”(116). 
The distally based sural artery neurocutaneous flap is 
not a complex flap, it is highly reliable, located far from 
the involved area and suitable for having its donor site 
repaired by primary closure.
However, it is not free of complications and as a re-
verse flow flap it is especially prone to complications in 
patients with associated vascular comorbidities such as 
diabetes, venous insufficiency and peripheral arteries dis-
eases. Patients over 40 years old also seem to correlate 
with a higher risk of flap failure(10).
Indications
This flap is mainly indicated to repair defects on 
the lower leg(64), ankle or foot in different circumstanc -
es(2,7,35,71) and particularly, for anterior or lateral post-burn 
contractures of the ankle(114). Even, treatment of calcane-
al osteomyelitis has been successfully treated with this 
type of flap(169).
Vascularization and Anatomy
Vascularization of the distally based sural flap is 
based on the same mechanisms of arterial retrograde 
flow and denervation of venous valves that happens when proximal arteries which have reliable distal inter -
connections with branches from other main vessels, are 
divided. Distal anastomoses and the high-pressure sys -
tem (as it is the arterial system,) allows a good retrograde 
flow in normal conditions. Venae comitantes, multiple in-
tercommunicating branches and denervation of valves, is 
enough to ensure venous drainage to the opposite phys-
iologic direction.
The artery accompanying the sural nerve pierces the 
deep fascia at the proximal posterior aspect of the calf 
and gives off several branches that vascularize the skin 
at the middle third of the calf. This artery courses distally 
with the sural nerve to anastomose with some of the 2 
to 5 perforator vessels that originate from the peroneal 
artery, which can be found proximal to the lateral malleo-
lus(141). Anastomoses are located 3 cm-5 cm proximal to 
the tip of the lateral malleolus and constitute the rotation 
point for the Sural neurocutaneous flap. 
Markings
The pivot point of the flap is localized about three fin-
gers’ breadth proximal to the tip of the lateral malleolus, 
midway between it and the Achilles’ tendon and the later-
al malleolus (fig. 7.99). The skin paddle is outlined with its 
vertical axis over the line between both Gastrocnemius 
muscles. Its upper or proximal limit is slightly above the 
junction of the two heads of both Gastrocnemius mus -
cles. The skin island is outlined over the middle third of 
the calf, as the skin of the proximal third is no longer 
vascularized by the sural artery. Elliptical outlining of the 
flap (fig. 7.99, 7.100) will facilitate primary closing of the 
donor area.
Wider flaps will be able to resurface wider defects, but 
it is important to rationalize between width and the pos -
sibility of a primary closing of the defect. One cm may be 
the difference between a direct closure of the donor area 
or the need for skin grafting.

Lower Limb334Elevation
Elevation of the flap can be facilitated by the use of 
a pneumatic tourniquet, as there is no need to precisely 
identify and isolate small perforator vessels. The flap can 
be raised with either a complete skin bridge overlying the 
pedicle or as an island flap with an adipofascial pedicle. 
For island flaps, an incision is made from the pivot point 
up to the lower limit of the cutaneous paddle. “W-like” in-cision is preferred as it allows wide exposure of the fas-
cial-adipose pedicle. 
However, dressings are applied.  If skin grafts have 
been used, they are covered with non-adherent dress -
ings and antibiotic ointment applied. The entire lower 
leg is protected with a well-padded, posterior plaster 
splint.Figure 7.99. A) Markings: The calf is divided in thirds and the skin paddle is outlined on the medial third. Lateral malleolus (black cross) and Achilles 
tendon (black line) are marked out. At the middle point between these two last markings is the point where the pedicle emerges and the pivot point 
is  located (red circle). The flap is outlined in an elliptical shape to facilitate the primary closure of the donor area. B) How  the distal sural pedicle 
works: the artery nourishing the skin island is fed by communicating vessels at the distal leg and accompanies the sural nerve along its course.

Figure 7.100. First step is to ele -
vate the skin flaps over the pedi -
cle at the subdermal level in both 
sides to preserve as much adi -
pose tissue as possible which is 
included in the pedicle where the 
sural nerve and vessels run.
Figure 7.101. Skin incision on 
the proximal boundary is done 
deep to the fascia, which is also 
incised. Below the fascia the su -
ral nerve and vessels are found 
between both heads of the gas -
trocnemius muscles. They are 
both divided and ligated.

both heads of the gastrocne -
mius muscle is incised deep to 
the muscle. At this stage it is 
safest to secure the cutaneous 
island to the fascia with some 
sutures in order to avoid acci -
dental tearing.
Figure 7.103. Fascia is fully in -
cised around the upper, medial 
and lateral borders of the skin 
paddle and elevation continues 
from proximal to distal.
Figure 7.104. Subfascial plane 
is completely safe and distal 
elevation of the flap is an easy 
and quick procedure. The pedi -
cle is raised until the pivot point 
is reached (3 fingers width or 5 
cm proximal to the lateral mal -
leolus.

Figure 7.105. Flap can easily ro -
tate to cover the entire calcane -
us area. After the flap has been 
inset on the recipient area, the 
donor area is primarily repaired 
or skin grafted.
Figure 7.106. The pedicle is long 
enough for the flap to reach and 
cover defects on the lateral or 
anterior aspect of the ankle.
However, dressings are applied.  If skin grafts have 
been used, they are covered with non-adherent dressings and antibiotic ointment applied. The entire lower leg is 
protected with a well-padded, posterior plaster splint.
