299Medial gastrocnemius myocutaneous flap
 MEDIAL GASTROCNEMIUS MYOCUTANEOUS FLAP
Gastrocnemius muscles, located in the posterior as-
pect of the calf, contribute to plantar flexion of the foot 
through their pull on the Achilles tendon. They also con -
tribute to knee flexion. The Gastrocnemius muscle has 
two heads and bellies. Raising both heads and bellies will 
lead to function impairment, as the soleus muscle alone 
cannot sufficiently preserve the lost function. However, 
rotation or transfer of only one of the Gastrocnemius 
muscle bellies will not mean significant function impair -
ment. It is a powerful contraction muscle and when it is 
used to cover a defect it has to be transferred in a com-
pletely denervated state.
It was one of the earliest muscle flaps described in 
Plastic surgery. Since it is relatively easy to elevate, it is 
a completely reliable neurovascular pedicle. Functional 
loss if only one head is transferred is minimal, as is the 
contour deformity. 
In the era of perforator flaps and microsurgical trans-
fers, when extensive use of knee prosthesis has become 
routine, especially in elderly patients, this flap still remains 
a primary preference for plastic and orthopaedic sur -
geons, and remains as a main tool in plastic surgery, to 
repair severe defects in and around the knee, as well as in 
the proximal third of the tibia(29,33,103).
Indications
The medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle is 
more commonly and extensively used, not only because 
it is wider and longer than the lateral head, but also be-
cause it has an easy and shorter way to rotate (the lateral 
head has to overcome the fibula on its way to the anterior 
aspect of the knee and tibia). It will depend on where the 
defect is located,in order to decide whether the medial or 
lateral belly of the muscle will be selected.
• Defects over the anterior and medial aspect of the knee 
as well as defects over the proximal third of the tibia are 
better covered by medial belly transposition.
• Defects on the lateral aspect of the knee and lateral as -
pect of the proximal third of the tibia are better treated 
by rotation of the lateral belly. By complete liberation of 
its origin at the lateral epicondyle it can also be used to cover the lateral distal quarter of the femur(151). If it is in -
tended to cover the anterior aspect of the knee, the mus -
cle has to be transferred deep to the peroneal nerve(100).
Fasciocutaneous and perforator flaps are currently 
selected to repair cutaneous defects around the knee as 
they are thinner than the voluminous muscle flaps and 
adapt and fit better than them. But  muscle transfer is 
still considered the best option to cover exposed bones, 
knee prosthesis and open joints. Gastrocnemius muscle 
has also been employed as a functional free transplant 
unit to restore elbow flexion, or as local transfer to restore 
drop foot(159).
Though gastrocnemius muscle can be transferred 
as a musculocutaneous flap, the skin island often chal-
lenges its capacity to fit bone defects and also acts as a 
physical obstacle for the muscle to reach further. That is 
why, if it is intended to repair bone defects, and particu -
larly, irregular defects of the tibia, this flap is better trans-
ferred exclusively as a muscular unit and then covered 
by split-thickness skin grafts. Two technical manoeuvres 
can be employed to increase the arc of rotation:
• Perform multiple transverse incisions in the thick apo -
neurosis, which lies on the deep surface of the muscle.
• Divide the proximal origin of the muscle.
However, the gastrocnemius muscle can be trans-
ferred with a cutaneous island as a musculocutaneous 
flap. In this case, the skin paddle can include the entire 
width of the calf with its superior limit below the popli -
teal fossa and its inferior limit about 10 cm beyond the 
muscle belly. Cutaneous islands wider than 5-6 cm will 
need to be repaired by skin grafting, while narrow islands 
will certainly be repaired by direct suture. When small and 
narrow skin islands are transferred with the muscle, it 
is advisable to use Doppler examination to confirm that 
cutaneous perforators are included in the paddle. Other-
wise, a trans-operative search of perforators has to be 
performed and if none are found, the skin island has to 
be appropriately modified in order to include one or two.
Gastrocnemius muscle can, however be transferred 
as a free flap(92) or chimeric flap(67).

Lower Limb300Anatomy and Vascularization
The gastrocnemius muscle has two heads and bod-
ies with two different anatomical origins. The Medial 
head originates on the posterior aspect of the femur me-
dial condyle posteriorly to the adductor magnus muscle. 
The lateral head originates on the lateral epicondyle of 
the femur. Both heads join at the upper third of the calf 
to end in a strong muscle aponeurosis that, joining with 
the distal aponeurosis of the soleus muscle, unite at the 
Achilles tendon that finally inserts at the posterior aspect 
of the calcaneus. 
The Gastrocnemius muscle is vascularized separate -
ly by three types of pedicles:
• Each of the bellies has its own main neurovascular ped -icle, and each one can be safely elevated, based on its 
own main pedicle, the medial and the lateral sural arter -
ies. Medial sural artery is usually longer, an average of 
5.1 cm (with a range of 1.6 cm -9.5 cm), while the later -
al sural artery has an average length of 4.8 cm (with a 
range 1.8 cm-9 cm)
•  Minor pedicle: Each muscle, at its distal half, is also sup -
plied by branches of the opposite sural artery.
• Minor pedicle: Musculocutaneous branch from the pos -
terior tibial artery. This branch divides itself into two 
muscular branches (one for the soleus and one for the 
distal part of the medial aspect of the medial head). This 
branch can be used as a pedicle for a muscular flap, in 
which, the entire medial body of the muscle can be ele -
vated and transferred(6).

Most of the musculocutaneous branches that vascu-
larize the overlying skin are found in the distal medial half 
of the muscle bellies.
The medial and lateral sural motor nerves, branches 
of the tibial nerve, innervate the gastrocnemius muscle. 
They enter the muscle on its deep proximal aspect to-
gether with the vascular pedicle. The sural nerve courses 
at the posterior aspect of the muscle between the two 
heads on an aponeurotic sheet. It is a good landmark to 
delimitate medial from lateral bellies. The Posterior fem-
oral cutaneous and saphenous nerves provide sensory 
innervation to the overlying skin of the medial belly. The 
saphenous nerve runs distally accompanying the greater 
saphenous vein near the medial side of the muscle. The 
sural nerve that runs distally accompanying the lesser 
saphenous vein in a subfascial plane innervates the skin 
overlying the lateral belly of the muscle.
Venous drainage of the flap is accomplished by the ve -
nae comitantes accompanying every artery nourishing the 
muscle and the overlying skin and subcutaneous tissue.
 MEDIAL GASTROCNEMIUS FLAP
As already described, the medial gastrocnemius is 
the most commonly used and its elevation differs from the lateral body. When transferred as a musculocutane -
ous flap, the cutaneous paddle can be harvested as en 
ellipse that extends vertically from the popliteal fossa to 
about 10 cm distally to the lower border of the muscular 
belly. 
Upper limit of the skin paddle should not be closer 
than 4-5 cm to the flexion crease at the popliteal fossa, in 
order to avoid interferences with knee motion. Width can 
range from 6 cm, up to 10 cm, though it can reach 15 cm 
(practically the whole posterior calf). For skin islands wid-
er than 5-6 cm, and depending on the age and biotype of 
the patient (skinny or obese) skin grafts will be necessary 
to repair the donor area. 
Markings
Pre-operatively the contour and volume of the muscle 
belly can be assessed clinically by exploring the flexion 
of the foot against resistance. This will facilitate outlining 
the muscle and especially musculocutaneous flap. Once 
in theatre, the patient is usually positioned in supine with 
the limb in external rotation and the knee slightly flexed. 
The incision is marked parallel to, and 2 cm behind the 
posterior border of the tibia and is extended for about 
10 cm.
