 GRACILIS MUSCULOCUTANEOUS FLAP
The first description of the Gracilis muscle to be trans-
ferred as a flap was in 1956 by Pickrell et al.(1) when they 
reported its use as a pure muscular flap to treat rectal 
incontinence. Later, in 1972, Orticochea(123) was credited 
with the idea of transferring a skin paddle of the thigh vas-
cularized by the Gracilis muscle.
The Gracilis is an expendable muscle that can be 
transferred as a pedicled or free flap, without causing a 
functional impairment for the leg.
Indications
As a pedicled flap it can be used to repair defects at 
the groin, ischial and perineal areas(86,150) as well as for 
vaginal reconstruction(103,107). As a free flap it has also 
been extensively used for functional repair of the elbow 
and hand(95) and particularly face palsy(50).
Anatomy and vascularization
Gracilis muscle is a flat, thin muscle that originates 
at the pubic symphysis and inserts at the medial condyle 
of the tibia. It extends subcutaneously in the medial thigh 
over the adductor magnus and between the adductor lon-
gus and the Sartorius anteriorly, and the semimembra-
nosus posteriorly. It acts as an accessory thigh adductor 
and is innervated by an anterior branch of the obturator 
nerve. This nerve courses obliquely between the adductor 
longus and magnus muscles, superiorly to the vascular 
pedicle(103). The nerve has to be preserved if a functional 
transfer is planned. The Gracilis muscle is vascularized 
by a major main pedicle, the Medial circumflex femoral 
artery that enters the muscle on its deep surface at the 
junction between the upper and medial thirds, approx-
imately at 8-10 cm distal to the inferior pubic tubercle. 
A secondary pedicle from the superficial femoral artery 
enters the muscle at the middle of the thigh, and a third 
somewhat minor pedicle enters the muscle distally; at 
the level of the medial condyle of the femur(25). These two fasciocutaneous branches emerge between the Gracilis 
and semimembranosus muscles at approximately 8 and 
15 cm proximal to the knee joint plane(27). Musculocu -
taneous perforators vascularize the overlying skin that 
extends beyond the muscular borders. The musculocu -
taneous flap can be safely raised based on its main pedi-
cle. However, if there is division of the distal pedicles, the 
distal third of the skin island over the muscle is seriously 
compromised. The saphena vein, (which is an important 
landmark for raising the cutaneous flap) is found oblique-
ly crossing the line between the pubic tubercle and the 
medial knee joint.
Markings
Medial condyle of the femur and pubic tubercle are 
first identified and a line is traced between them as a ref-
erence for the anterior edge of the Gracilis muscle (see 
picture and legend below). The main pedicle is localized 8 
to 10 cm distally to the pubic tubercle, while distant pedi-
cles enter the muscle at approximately 8 and 15 cm from 
the knee joint plane. The Myocutaneous flapâ€™s distal third 
(red lines) will not be completely reliable if these distal 
pedicles are divided. An important landmark that has to 
be localized and identified is the saphenous vein.
Elevation
Elevation of the flap starts by a distal incision on the 
cutaneous paddle to localize an important anatomical 
reference: the saphenous vein. The vein has to be pre-
served and is the main landmark to localize the Gracilis 
muscle.
Though in the case shown below the distal part of 
the flap has been partially detached from the muscle, it is 
safer to keep the whole skin paddle attached to the mus -
cle. It is advisable to secure the dermis of the skin paddle 
to the muscle with sutures to prevent accidental tearing. 
See pictures and legends below.

Lower Limb292Figure 7.34. A dotted line (grey 
line) is traced between the medi -
al condyle of the femur and the 
pubic tubercle. 2 cm posterior to 
this line, another line (grey line) 
is traced representing the ante -
rior edge of the Gracilis muscle. 
8cm to 10 cm distal to the pubic 
tubercle, the main pedicle enters 
the deep surface of the muscle. 
The cutaneous paddle is outlined 
beyond the margins of the Grac -
ilis muscle. For pedicled flaps 
where distant pedicles have to 
be divided, the distal third of the 
cutaneous island is not reliable.
Figure 7.35. Surgery starts by 
incising the skin distal to the 
flap to localize and identify the 
saphenous vein, which has to 
be preserved and used as a 
landmark to localize the distal 
body of the Gracilis muscle. An -
terior to this vein, coursing dis -
tally between the Vastus Media -
lis and the Gracilis muscle, runs 
the saphenous nerve (branch 
of the femoral nerve) that also 
has to be preserved (not shown 
here, see 7.40a).

Figure 7.36. Posteriorly to the saphenous vein, the fascia is opened to identify and isolate the lower body of the Gracilis muscle. Subfascial dissection will 
preserve the vein and nerve. By traction of the distal muscle, the upper part of the Gracilis, as well as its cutaneous territory can be accurately identified.

muscle body identified along its

are divided. 
Figure 7.38. Anteriorly, the Graci -
lis is detached from the adductor 
longus. Lateral branches from 
the saphenous vein are divid -
ed and ligated. Although in this 
case, the distal part of the flap 
has been partially detached from 
the muscle, it is safer to keep the 
whole skin paddle secured to the 
muscle with sutures.

taking extreme care in doing so.
