 PERONEAL ARTERY PERFORATOR FLAP
Morphology of the lateral aspect of the leg is such that 
even in heavy individuals thin or relatively thin flaps can be 
harvested from this region. This is why extensive anatom -
ic studies were performed to get a clear view of the skin 
vascularization of this area(5,14,135,149,162). However, some mi -
nor discrepancies, that will be discussed later, were found.
The peroneal artery perforator flap was first described 
by Yoshimura et al. in 1990(162), based on an extensive an-
atomic dissection of 80 cadavers. It is a thin flap that can 
be pedicled proximally or distally depending on the select-
ed perforator and can be used as a regional pedicled or 
free flap. Donor areas of flaps harvested on the proximal 
half of the lower leg can usually be repaired by primary 
suture. While flaps elevated on the distal third of the leg 
usually require skin grafting.
Perforator vessels are usually short and if it is intended to 
use the flap as a pedicled flap, perforators should be traced 
in the septum or through the muscle, to the peroneal vessels. 
At this stage loupe magnification is highly advisable.
Indications
This flap has the great advantage of being thin and 
pliable with a long pedicle (if it is traced deep). As a pedi-cled flap it can be used to repair defects around the ankle 
and heel(19). As a free flap it has been extensively used 
for intraoral reconstruction(152) and even for treatment of 
cervical post-burn contractures(147). 
Vascularization and anatomy
The flap is mainly supplied by perforator cutaneous 
vessels branching off the peroneal artery in a mean num -
ber of four(135) or five(152). The proximal and distal perfora -
tors are constant and can generally be localized at 5cm to 
15 cm below the fibula head (proximal perforator) or in the 
supramalleolar area (distal perforator)(152). Occasionally, 
these perforator branches come from the posterior tibial 
artery. A different matter is the way by which these branch -
es emerge to the skin. According to Wolf(153), it seems that 
these cutaneous perforators tend to be musculocutaneous 
in the proximal third of the lower leg (through the hallucis 
longus muscle) and septocutaneous in the distal third of 
the lower leg (posterior intermuscular septum). So, it will 
depend on where the flap is harvested from, as to whether 
the nourishing vessels will be found as musculocutaneous 
or septocutaneous perforators. However, each perforator is 
accompanied by two venae comitantes.

as septocutaneous vessel while the perforator coming (occasionally) from the posterior tibial artery is shown as a musculocutaneous perforator. 1. Musculocutaneous perforators

Lower Limb322Markings
Two references are marked first, the lateral malleolus 
and the fibular head and the peroneal shaft in between. A 
line is marked between the distal third and the two prox-
imal thirds. Proximally to this line a constant perforator 
is usually found. However, Doppler examination provides 
more accurate information about its emerging point. The 
flap can be outlined centered on the emerging point, or 
slightly displaced, depending on how should it rotate or where the final defect is located. One single perforator 
vascularizes an average skin area of 7 cm by 12 cm(152).
Elevation
For flaps harvested on the middle area, the most 
proximal incision should be made approximately 5 cm 
to 8 cm distal to the fibular head, to avoid accidental in -
jury to the common peroneal nerve.
Figure 7.79. Outlining a peroneal artery perforator flap. Fibular head and shaft with the supramalleolar eminence are marked, as well as the limit be -
tween the middle and distal third of the fibula. Over this line a constant perforator can be found. Acoustic Doppler examination helps to determine the 
exact point where the perforator emerges to the skin.

vation should stop 2-3 cm away 
from the posterior compart -
ment. At this level, the fascia is 
incised and dissection contin -
ues subfascially, leaving a secu -
rity cuff of fascia before reach -
ing the posterior septum.
Figure 7.83. The fascia of the 
Peroneus longus muscle is el -
evated and left attached to the 
cutaneous paddle until the pos -
terior septum is reached. Very 
carefully, particularly if perfora -
tors had not been precisely lo -
calized by Doppler examination, 
the septum is opened and blunt 
examination continues to search 
for arising perforators.
Figure 7.84. In this case, where 
the flap has been based on a 
distal pedicle, proximal septal 
attachments are divided as well 
as proximal perforators. But all 
distal perforator vessels should 
be explored and preserved be -
fore continuing to liberate the 
flap. Remember that proximal -
ly, perforators arising from the 
deep down use to be musculo -
cutaneous perforators and dis -
tally use to be septocutaneous 
perforators.

Figure 7.85. Distal perforators 
are identified emerging through 
the septum. Though usually 
the largest perforator should 
be the preferred option, in the 
case of regional pedicled flaps 
the best-positioned perforator 
determines its selection as 
pedicle. In other words, the one 
that will allow better and easier 
rotation of the flap should be 
selected.
Figure 7.86. Once the main per -
forator vessel has been selected, 
the others are divided,to free the 
cutaneous paddle of the flap.
Figure 7.87. With the main per -
forator localized and preserved, 
the pedicle is freed from the 
posterior aspect.

pedicle is checked, and as soon 
as it enables the flap to cover 
the full defect, individualization 
of vessels stops. The flap can 
easily reach all the area around 
the ankle.Figure 7.88. Perforators are 
usually short and should be 
traced retrograde to the pero -
neal vessels to gain length for 
the pedicle. At this stage, loupe 
magnification is highly advis -
able, as vessels are small and 
delicate.
