 PROFUNDA FEMORIS ARTERY (ADDUCTOR) PERFORATOR  
FLAP
The constant search for a flap that can best fulfil 
all requirements was pursued, particularly in the field 
of breast reconstruction. Microsurgical techniques and 
perforator flaps made the Deep inferior epigastric flap 
(DIEP) the first option of choice for breast reconstruction. 
A short time later, the buttocks seem to be a good and 
reasonable option when no good tissue was available on 
the patients belly, but the buttocks have also their own 
limitations. The Profunda artery Perforator flap seems to 
be a better option for some authors(23) than superior or 
inferior gluteal perforator flaps.
Some confusion appears in the literature as perfora-
tor branches of the profunda femoris artery are found to 
supply different flaps from different cutaneous territories:
• Baek in 1983(8) described the lateral thigh flap, which 
was based on the third perforator of the Profunda femo -
ris artery.
• Maruyama et al, in 1984, described a flap, the lateral 
thigh fascio-cutaneous flap, from the first perforator of 
the Profunda femoris artery.
• A flap called “Profunda femoris artery perforator” is also 
seen described in the literature(109). It corresponds, in fact, 
to what was described by Baek, but showing three differ -
ent levels of the lateral aspect of the thigh, depending if it 
is based on the second, third or fourth perforator branch -
es from the lateral branch of the profunda femoris artery.
• A different flap was described by Angrigiani et al. in 
2001(4), the adductor perforator flap; based on the ad -
ductor magnus muscle cutaneous perforator that is the 
first medial branch of the profunda femoris artery.
• Another flap with a fairly similar name has been pub -
lished as the “Profunda artery perforator flap”(23).
Description of local anatomy and skin vasculariza -
tion of the posterior and medial skin of the thigh was 
described by Cormack and Lamberty in 1985(24), but it is 
Angrigiani et al. who are credited to be the first describ-
ing and utilizing this flap in 2001(4) under the name of the 
Adductor flap.
The Profunda femoris artery perforator flap (PFAP-
first medial branch) basically transfers cutaneous adi -pose tissue from the medial posterior aspect of the thigh 
based on a perforator from the profunda femoris artery 
(or deep femoral artery)(4). It is a relatively large flap (up to 
30 x 23 cm) that is harvested from a hidden area that fi-
nally results in a more or less concealed scar on the groin 
or medial thigh, depending on the flap’s design. It can be 
transferred as a pedicle or free flap. Despite these advan-
tages, the flap can be rather narrow. According to McRae 
et al, it has an inconsistent dominant perforator location, 
which makes it mandatory to perform preoperative stud -
ies to localize the nourishing vessels(108).
Indications
It can effectively cover and repair perineal defects or 
regional severe pressure sores as a pedicled or propeller 
flap(133). As a free flap, it has been successfully used as a 
secondary option in small and medium size breast recon-
struction.
Anatomy and vascularization
The profunda femoris artery gives off lateral and medi -
al branches. The lateral branches enter the adductor com -
partment at approximately 8 cm distal to the groin crease  
(see fig. 7.17). The first, or the more proximal, branch of 
the medial branches that originates from the profunda 
femoris artery (or deep femoral artery) vascularizes the in -
tegument of the medial subgluteal region. It courses medi -
ally and posteriorly between the Adductor longus anterior -
ly and the Adductor major and brevis muscles posteriorly 
to enter the mass of the Adductor magnus muscle. This 
is where it gives off multiple muscular branches. Finally, 
it traverses the muscle to enter the subcutaneous space, 
about 2-4 cm posterior to the posterior border of the Grac -
ilis muscle. It runs in a postero-inferior direction, where its 
branches anastomose with those cutaneous branches 
coming from the Gracilis pedicle(3). However, at the upper 
posterior thigh diverse angiosomes overlap themselves 
and consequently flaps from this area can be harvested 
based on different perforator systems, such as the inferior 
gluteal artery or medial circumflex femoral artery(108).

Markings
The flap can be outlined in two ways, as a horizontal or 
a vertical ellipse, though the references are the same for 
both. It can be transferred as a pedicled flap, a propeller 
flap or a free flap. According to Angrigiani, the patient is po -
sitioned in supine position with the hip flexed and abducted 
and the knee also flexed. Under this position the adductor 
longus muscle is tensioned and the Gracilis muscle relaxed. 
When the leg is extended the Gracilis muscle becomes ten -sioned and can be easily palpated. A line is traced over the 
posterior border of the Gracilis muscle. Parallel to this line a 
new line is drawn 2 cm posteriorly. Over this line a point is 
marked 8cm distally to the inguinal crease.
The patient can also be accommodated (according to 
McRae) in the lithotomy position. Landmarks include the 
gluteal fold and groin crease, the Gracilis muscle medially 
and the posterior limit of the iliotibial band laterally. The skin 
paddle is harvested from the upper third of this area. The 

## Page 3

283Gracilis muscle is localized and the emergence for the ped -
icle is marked out in an area 2-4 cm posterior to the Gracilis 
muscle and about 8 cm inferior to the inguinal crease.
It will depend on the size and location of the defect 
and the convenience of a primary closing of the donor 
area, whether the flap will be harvest horizontally or ver-
tically; as the flap can be designed in any direction and 
shape around the emergence point of the cutaneous 
branch of the posterior artery.Doppler examination is highly advisable to localize the 
exact point of emergence for the artery.
Elevation
The flap can be elevated with the patient accommo-
dated either in lateral decubitus supine position (3) or in 
supine-lithotomy position(108). For technical details see 
legends below.Profunda femoris artery (Adductor) perforator flap
Figure 7.18. Profunda femoris 
artery perforator flap refer -
ences: Adductor longus (AL) 
and Gracilis (G) muscles are 
localized as well as the ingui -
nal crease. Between 2 to 4 cm 
posteriorly to the posterior bor -
der of the Gracilis muscle and 
8 cm distal to the groin crease 
the PFA vessels are localized. 
In this Doppler examination (red 
cross) helps in localizing the ex -
act point of emergence.
Figure 7.19. In this case the 
horizontal ellipse has been out -
lined. Incisions are made on 
the anterior aspect deep to the 
muscular fascia, over the Scar -
pa’s aponeurosis. Continuing 
to proceed posteriorly over the 
fascia, the saphenous and pu -
dendal veins are found. While 
the saphenous vein is respect -
ed, the pudendal vein is usually 
divided to gain access.
