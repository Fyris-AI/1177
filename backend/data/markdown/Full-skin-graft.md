49STA Galea Pedicled Flap
Figure 4.10. A) Frontal scalp 
flap elevated. The plane of dis -
section between the cutane -
ous flap and galea (containing 
the terminal branches of the 
STA) can be seen in a fresh 
cadaver dissection. B) Surgical 
plane to individualize the galea 
from the scalp. If great atten -
tion is paid, small black tips 
can be seen on the scalp sur -
face which are in fact the roots 
of the individual hair bulbs. 
This is the proper planeâ€“see -
ing the bulbs but never incising 
them.
Figure 4.11. Proximal dissec -
tion over the common trunk of 
the STA should be carried out 
carefully to avoid injury and 
to search for each of the main 
branches.

dissected free from its cuta -
neous attachments and traced 
up to midline.
Figure 4.14. Galea flap out -
lined including both branches 
of the STA. It is incised deep to 
the periostium and the super -
ficial temporal fascia without 
including them in the flap.
Figure 4.13. Anterior and pos -
terior cutaneous scalp flaps 
have been elevated and folded 
anteriorly and posteriorly to 
expose both the frontal and 
parietal branches. Contrary to 
classical descriptions, in this 
specimen the frontal branch is 
larger than the parietal branch.

51STA Galea Pedicled Flap
Figure 4.15. Once the flap has 
been completely incised it is 
then detached from the perios -
tium distally and the tempora -
lis fascia proximally. Elevation 
is easy and quick compared 
with dissection from the scalp. 
However, temporal vessels in -
cluded into the galea should 
not be injured. Small perfora -
tor branches vascularizing the 
cranial vault are divided, while 
major branches are divided 
and ligated.

Figure 4.17. Galea flap already 
elevated showing from its 
deep surface the STA and its 
two main branches, the Frontal 
branch (FB sta) and Parietal 
branch (PB sta). In case a lon -
ger pedicle is needed, STA and 
galea can be traced over the 
zygomatic arch.
