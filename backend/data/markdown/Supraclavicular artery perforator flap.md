91Supraclavicular artery perforator flap
This flap described by Lamberty in 1979(65) is an 
axial cutaneous perforator flap extending from the 
base of the neck to the skin over the Deltoid muscle. In 
fact, the skin over the proximal third of the arm could 
be simultaneously elevated with the flap, though it is 
not recommended without delay, because this area is 
not nourished by direct cutaneous branches from the 
main vessels, and so, there is the risk of distal necro -
sis. Because of its wide arc of rotation, which ensures 
a 180-degree mobilization anteriorly and posteriorly, the 
flap can reach distant sites when harvested, especially 
as a pure island flap(39,78). It is advisable and less risky 
to extend the flap length up to the middle zone of the shoulder (see figs. 5.5 and 5.6). If a longer flap is needed, 
a delay procedure is advisable as is the case for the de -
layed Cervicohumeral flap. As an axial flap it can be long 
and narrow and can easily reach the opposite part of the 
neck as well as the axillary area.
 Ideally, this flap has to be designed in such way that 
its donor area can be primarily closed avoiding skin grafts 
over this rather visible area. What makes this flap the first 
option for neck repair is its versatility. It can be outlined 
in various different ways that is able to provide relatively 
large skin paddles, while donor areas are repaired by pri -
mary closing. It can be tailored as a single pedicled flap, 
island tunnelled flap(82), anterior bilobed flap and posterior

tissue expanders are available) to enlarge the skin paddle 
and facilitate donor area closing with a free tension suture.
Indications
This flap is long and highly mobile and so it can reach 
distant defects in the face, axilla and opposite anterior and 
lateral aspects of the neck. Because its size (4 to 10 cm 
in width and 20 to 30 cm in length) and its wide arch of 
rotation, it can be mobilized as an island patch for limited 
distant defects (axilla or throat) or as a large bilobed flap 
(anterior-lateral neck defects). It represents an ideal option 
for neck or mentosternal post-burn skin contractures(81).
Vascularization
The flap is based on the supraclavicular artery, a cuta -
neous perforator arising from the transverse cervical artery. 
It enters the skin fat pad at the base of the posterior trian -
gle of the neck and runs directly towards the acromiocla -
vicular joint(29). Over the shoulder this artery anastomoses 
with cutaneous terminal vessels of the posterior circumflex 
humeral artery. This distal network of cutaneous branches 
allows for the possible extent of the flap to the upper third 
of the arm, though it is uncertain and not advisable. Markings
Markings starts by outlining the posterior border of 
the Sternocleidomastoideus muscle, the course of the 
jugular vein and the clavicle axis. These three lines will 
delimitate a triangle where the cutaneous branch to the 
flap will emerge branching off the transverse cervical ar-
tery (see fig. 5.7). Reference points to design the flap are 
marked out approximately at the centre of this triangle 
as well as the tip of the acromion. A straight line joining 
the two points is drawn, which will be the axis of the flap 
(white line). The supraclavicular artery and its cutaneous 
branches are found along this line. The skin paddle is de -
signed according to how far the flap has to reach, the way 
it should rotate and the defect’s size. It can be designed 
as a single pedicle flap, island flap, anterior or posterior 
bilobed flap. The size can be between 16 cm long and 8 
cm wide. The width of the pedicle should be the width of 
the skin island. The length of the flap can be extended up 
to the upper third of the arm (though it is not advisable). 
It is much safer if the skin paddle doesn’t extend beyond 
the deltoid muscle, 5 cm further from the acromion is a 
reasonable length for the flap.
The high versatility of this flap is shown in the follow-
ing, different cases:

icled flap or an island flap. The flap has to be raised as 
thickly as possible as the artery runs to the acromion into 
the subcutaneous tissue. 
Island flaps always fit better than skin pedicled 
flaps and don’t waste the skin over the pedicle at rota -tion point, though in certain circumstances (as in many 
neck contractures release) the skin over the pedicle 
can also be use to resurface part of the ipsilateral neck. 
Island flaps are better transfered by tunnelling them 
under the skin. Subcutaneous undermining should be Figure 5.8. The cutaneous 
patch island is outlined over the 
flap’s axis. From the proximal 
tip of the skin patch to the ori -
gin of the supraclavicular artery 
a “W” incision is marked out.
Figure 5.9. Following the “W” 
incision on the supraclavicular 
fossa, anterior skin is incised 
only to subdermal layer. The 
resulting triangular skin flaps 
are elevated strictly subder -
mally exposing all subcutane -
ous tissue along the pedicle. 
Electrocauthery should be used 
prudently and at low gradation. 
Elevation starts around the 
distal half of the island patch, 
where the incision is made 
deep into the Deltoid’s fascia.

tion is also performed on the 
posterior cutaneous flaps over

elevation continues subfascial -

Figure 5.13. Once the inser -
tion of Deltoid muscle to the 
clavicle is reached, dissection 
continues over the periostium 
(in very thin patients dissection 
can be performed subperios -
tically), to reach the supracla -
vicular fossa. Accidental thin -
ning of the flap will definitely 
damage the artery. This is also 
true regarding extensive use of 
electrocauthery. Flap elevation 
is technically more difficult in 
thinner patients than in over -
weight ones.
Figure 5.14. Dissection contin -
ues deep on the supraclavicu -
lar fossa, taking care not to go 
too deep or too superficial. The 
superficial jugular vein is the 
reference (if required) to know 
how far internal elevation of 
the flap should reach. Usually, 
it is not necessary to go further 
than the posterior triangle of 
the neck, as it is not necessary 
to individualize the vessels.

icle is over-passed, dissection 
continues under the trapezius 
fascia on the posterior aspect 
of the pedicle, and deep sub -
cutaneously on the anterior 
aspect. The jugular vein is the 
landmark to the pedicle that 
can be seen in the undersurface 
of the flap.

side it is far better to transpose 
it by tunnelling the pedicle.

ample enough to allow easy passage of the skin pad -
dle island from the donor to the recipient site. The skin 
paddle has to be secured, (specially at its tip), to the 
subcutaneous tissue and fascia, using some stitches, 
to avoid accidental tearing when it is pulled into posi -
tion through the tunnel. Any minor sign of swelling and 
venous congestion should be immediately checked 
and the tunnel widened if necessary. Venous conges -tion is usually the main cause of flap necrosis. Once 
the flap is rotated into place, general rules about how 
to suit the seams and fit the aesthetic-functional units 
have to be followed.
Adequate pre-operative design will allow the donor 
area to be repaired primarily. However, if too much 
tension prevents a safe repair, skin grafts should be 
used.
