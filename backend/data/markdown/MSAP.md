327Medial sural artery perforator flap
 MEDIAL SURAL ARTERY PERFORATOR FLAP
Searching for new donor areas where free flaps could 
be harvested, Taylor and Daniel(143) were the first (in 1975), 
to describe a cutaneous flap of the calf, based on a ves-
sel, which, branching off from the sural artery, traversed 
the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle to supply 
the skin. In other words, a flap based in musculocutane -
ous perforator vessels.
During the era of fasciocutaneous flaps, multiple stud -
ies where addressed to search for nourishing vessels that 
supply cutaneous flaps in the calf region. Despite multiple 
anatomic studies about the superficial vascularization of 
this area, such as those published by Haerchst(45) or Pont -
en(126), superficial vascularization of the calf was unclear 
for the purpose of free tissue transferring. Different publi -
cations(32,132,154) concluded that vessels distribution in this 
area, or even their presence, made this area unreliable for 
harvesting microsurgical flaps.
Twenty-one years after the accurate description by 
Taylor and Daniel(143) about musculocutaneous vessels 
supplying a flap in the calf region, during the era of per-
forator flaps, it was Montegut et al in 1996(111) who first 
described the Median sural artery perforator local flap, 
supplied by a reliable and constant musculocutaneous 
perforator artery. First description about the clinical use 
of this flap, supported by an anatomical study, was pre-
sented by Cavadas et al.(17).
The medial sural artery perforator flap is a reliable and 
relatively thin flap, (between 4 mm and 10 mm) which can 
be elevated as a pedicled or free flap. A constant muscu -
locutaneous perforator artery, which is present in more 
than 90% of the patients(17,49,74,142) nourishes the flap. Its 
donor site can be repaired primarily, or skin grafted. An-
other advantage is that it has a long pedicle if vessels are 
traced deep into the muscle (average length of 10 cm-12 
cm) and at least one of the perforators has a diameter of 
2 mm(155).
This flap can also be elevated as a neurosensitive 
flap, if the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve is included.
Disadvantages concerning this flap are mainly related 
to the donor site, because hypertrophic scars, numbness, 
paresthesia and even limited muscle weakness can oc-
cur after raising the flap. This also has to be taken into 
consideration for women, for aesthetic reasons.Another disadvantage, that this flap shares with the 
majority of perforator flaps. is that it depends on the exis-
tence of at least one perforator artery, the emerging point 
of which, can vary considerably.
Indications
As a free flap (a relatively thin free flap) it can be used 
to repair head, neck, as well as intraoral defects(18,20,73,74), 
and defects of the extremities(63,70,165). As a pedicled flap it 
has been mainly used to repair defects around the knee.
Vascularization and anatomy
The Medial sural artery perforator flap is supplied by 
a musculocutaneous perforator artery that branches off 
directly from the sural artery. This or these perforator ves-
sels emerge from the medial gastrocnemius head to sup -
ply the skin over this muscle. References to localize the 
emerging point vary greatly between authors. Cavadas et 
al.(17) found a mean of 2.2 perforators emerging from 12 
cm to 17 cm distal to the popliteal crease. While Wong et 
al. found between 2 and 6 perforators emerging between 
6cm and 22.5 cm(157) found perforators between 10 cm 
and 16 cm. Perforators are usually found at a distance of 
0.5 cm and 4 cm from the posterior midline(60,61). These 
perforators may be absent in about 10% of patients so 
the flap should then be raised as a fasciocutaneous flap, 
instead of a perforator flap.
The calf region is vascularized by a mixed system of 
superficial and deep vascular systems. In this region it 
seems that there is an inverse relationship between these 
two systems(47) and when very small or none perforators 
from the deep system are present, it is the superficial sys -
tem which vascularizes the flap.
Venous drainage used to come from the venae com-
itantes that accompany the artery. But for predominant 
perforator arteries emerging near the midline of the calf, 
venous drainage is addressed towards venous branches, 
accompanying the medial sural cutaneous nerve or the 
lesser saphenous vein. In these cases or when venous 
drainage is unclear a superficial vein should be included 
within the flap(46).

Lower Limb328Markings
References to find the most common point where 
perforator vessels emerge from the muscle were de -
scribed by Kim et al.(76) and Kao et al.(73) with similar re-
sults. Markings start by localizing the midpoint over the 
flexion crease at the popliteal area and the midpoint of 
the medial malleolus, which are both marked out. A line is 
then traced between these two points. On this line a point 
is marked at 8 cm and a second point at 15 cm from the popliteal crease. About 2 cm around each point, perfora-
tor vessels can be localized.
Generally, authors conclude that emerging perfora-
tor points are about 10cm and 16 cm from the popliteal 
crease. But it is also true that it cannot be predicted pre-
cisely based solely on anatomic landmarks.
A preoperative mapping of perforator vessels can be 
precisely achieved if assisted with a Doppler acoustic de -
vice(164), colour duplex ultrasound(84) or CT angiography(58).Figure 7.90. Medial sural artery perforator flap: anatomical references.1. Popliteal artery

329Elevation
The flap is generally raised with the patient in prone 
position, though it can also be elevated with the patient in 
lateral-supine position. The leg is then rotated outwards and abducted and the knee slightly flexed. As in most 
perforator flaps, no tourniquet is used to allow filling of 
vessels, especially the veins, and facilitate their visual -
ization.Medial sural artery perforator flap
Figure 7.91. Midpoints on the 
popliteal crease and malleolus 
are marked and a line between 
them is traced. 8 cm distal to the 
popliteal crease, over the same 
line, a point is also marked out 
(red cross). Emerging points of 
perforator vessels are usual -
ly found inside a circle of 2 cm 
around this point. However, this 
anatomical landmark is approxi -
mate and not very accurate. Even 
when assisted by a Doppler de -
vice, the selected perforator has 
to be seen and identified before 
incising the entire skin paddle.
Figure 7.93. Once the perfora -
tor has been localized, the deep 
fascia is incised longitudinally 
to expose the medial head of the 
gastrocnemius muscle. There is 
always the possibility of finding 
no reliable perforators and the 
possibility of an accidental tear -
ing at this stage. If so, the flap 
should then be raised like a fas -
ciocutaneous flap. Figure 7.92. Skin incision is 
always performed keeping a 
safety distance of 2cm or 3 cm 
away from any suspected perfo -
rator. Incision is made deep to 
the fascia and blunt dissection 
is continued until any perforator 
piercing the fascia is localized. 
Any superficial vein entering 
the skin paddle should be pre -
served at this stage.

flected with great care to ex -

are not yet divided. Proximally, 
muscular fibers are also opened 
leaving a cuff of muscular and 
fatty tissue attached to the ves -
sels; as additional safety and 
protection of the pedicle.
Figure 7.95. Fascia and muscle 
are opened from distal to prox -
imal, isolating the perforator 
vessels and dividing and ligat -
ing any collateral branch to the

should not be spared and the 
pedicle should be left with a lay -
er of muscular-areolar tissue.

333Distally based sural artery neurocutaneous flap
 DISTALLY BASED SURAL ARTERY NEUROCUTANEOUS FLAP
The distally based Sural flap was first described by 
Donski and Fogdestam in 1983(30) and later popularized 
by Masquelet et al.(102). It is a neurocutaneous flap, which 
means that the vessel accompanying a cutaneous sen-
sitive nerve, the sural nerve in this case, supplies the 
skin paddle of the flap. This type of vascularization was 
already suggested by Salmon in 1936(129), and Quenu 
and Lejars(127) in 1892. Different authors later stated that 
vessels accompanying cutaneous nerves, routinely pen-
etrate the deep fascia and/or pierce it(13) while also tra-
versing  adipose tissue(115).These types of flaps were then 
named “Neurocutaneous perforator flaps” or “Venoneuro-
adipofascial flaps”(116). 
The distally based sural artery neurocutaneous flap is 
not a complex flap, it is highly reliable, located far from 
the involved area and suitable for having its donor site 
repaired by primary closure.
However, it is not free of complications and as a re-
verse flow flap it is especially prone to complications in 
patients with associated vascular comorbidities such as 
diabetes, venous insufficiency and peripheral arteries dis-
eases. Patients over 40 years old also seem to correlate 
with a higher risk of flap failure(10).
Indications
This flap is mainly indicated to repair defects on 
the lower leg(64), ankle or foot in different circumstanc -
es(2,7,35,71) and particularly, for anterior or lateral post-burn 
contractures of the ankle(114). Even, treatment of calcane-
al osteomyelitis has been successfully treated with this 
type of flap(169).
Vascularization and Anatomy
Vascularization of the distally based sural flap is 
based on the same mechanisms of arterial retrograde 
flow and denervation of venous valves that happens when proximal arteries which have reliable distal inter -
connections with branches from other main vessels, are 
divided. Distal anastomoses and the high-pressure sys -
tem (as it is the arterial system,) allows a good retrograde 
flow in normal conditions. Venae comitantes, multiple in-
tercommunicating branches and denervation of valves, is 
enough to ensure venous drainage to the opposite phys-
iologic direction.
The artery accompanying the sural nerve pierces the 
deep fascia at the proximal posterior aspect of the calf 
and gives off several branches that vascularize the skin 
at the middle third of the calf. This artery courses distally 
with the sural nerve to anastomose with some of the 2 
to 5 perforator vessels that originate from the peroneal 
artery, which can be found proximal to the lateral malleo-
lus(141). Anastomoses are located 3 cm-5 cm proximal to 
the tip of the lateral malleolus and constitute the rotation 
point for the Sural neurocutaneous flap. 
Markings
The pivot point of the flap is localized about three fin-
gers’ breadth proximal to the tip of the lateral malleolus, 
midway between it and the Achilles’ tendon and the later-
al malleolus (fig. 7.99). The skin paddle is outlined with its 
vertical axis over the line between both Gastrocnemius 
muscles. Its upper or proximal limit is slightly above the 
junction of the two heads of both Gastrocnemius mus -
cles. The skin island is outlined over the middle third of 
the calf, as the skin of the proximal third is no longer 
vascularized by the sural artery. Elliptical outlining of the 
flap (fig. 7.99, 7.100) will facilitate primary closing of the 
donor area.
Wider flaps will be able to resurface wider defects, but 
it is important to rationalize between width and the pos -
sibility of a primary closing of the defect. One cm may be 
the difference between a direct closure of the donor area 
or the need for skin grafting.
