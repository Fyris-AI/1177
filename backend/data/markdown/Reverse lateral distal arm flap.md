203Reverse Lateral distal arm flap
This is a fasciocutaneous flap on the distal lateral as-
pect of the arm that has been partially and previously de -
scribed as the extension of the proximal Lateral arm flap; 
specifically for elbow coverage(13,18). A great advantage 
of the reverse Lateral Arm flap is that the skin over and 
around the elbow is usually thin and, even in overweight 
patients, is ideal for anterior elbow repair.
Indications
As stated previously, regarding whether the flap can 
be based proximally or distally will depend on what is 
needed and where the defect is located. For elbow cov-
erage, the proximally based flap fits all requirements in 
texture, colour and especially thickness. Even in over-
weight patients, the combined thickness of both the skin 
and subcutaneous tissue is usually thin, which makes 
this flap especially useful to resurface defects over joints, 
face and neck. This flap can also be used as an adipofas-
cial flap(44) to cover defects around the elbow. As there 
is not skin elevated with the flap, the adipofascial paddle 
can be larger with no concerns about the primary closure 
of the donor area.
Vascularization
As the Posterior radial collateral artery (PRCA), 
courses down, it becomes more superficial and ends in a vascular subcutaneous plexus around the epicondy -
lar and olecranon area, interconnecting with the Radial 
recurrent artery ( RRA) and the Interosseous recurrent 
artery (IRA)(18). Terminal branches of these two arteries 
nourish the skin on the lateral aspect of the lower arm 
and elbow. The reverse flap can be vascularized in either 
of these two systems (see figs. 6.44 and 6.45). However, 
the RRA is larger and better positioned than the IRA, for a 
longer pedicle.
Markings
A template from the defect is used to see the extension 
and shape of the flap. As this flap is raised over an area 
vascularized for three main vessels, (the Posterior radial 
collateral (PRCA), the Radial recurrent  (RRA) and the In -
terosseous recurrent arteries (IRA), two reference lines are 
traced. Firstly, a line is drawn between the acromion and 
epicondyle. Approximately 2 cm lateral to this line lays the 
axis of the Lateral arm flap. A second line is traced between 
the lateral epicondyle and styloid process. Both lines repre -
sent the central axis for this flap. The skin area can mea -
sure up to 12-16 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle, over 
the proximal radial region of the forearm(59). The flap is out -
lined over the distal third of the arm, around the central axis 
that represents the lateral intermuscular septum (through 
which the Posterior Radial collateral artery courses) and 
can be extended over the proximal third of the forearm. REVERSE LATERAL DISTAL ARM FLAP

Upper Limb204Elevation
The distal arm component has been previously dealt 
with extensively in the description of the lateral arm flap. 
Initial steps to reach and isolate the pedicle (PRCA) are ex -
actly the same as for the Distally based lateral arm flap, 
so it is good to refer back to these sections for further and 
detailed information. 
Surgery is initiated under controlled ischemia with a 
tourniquet in a high position. Elevation of the flap starts 
with a full thickness incision along one of its borders, ante -
rior or posterior. (Refer to pictures and accompanying leg -
ends.) Anteriorly, the flap is dissected subfascially from the 
biceps and brachioradialis, until the intermuscular septum 
(where the PRCA runs) is reached. The vascular pedicle is 
located at the deepest part of the septum, very close to the 
humerus bone.
As previously mentioned, the distally based flap is vas -
cularized by three main arteries that anastomose in a wide 
arterial system. The flap can thus be elevated, based on 
one, or several of these arteries and vascular systems or 
networks(18,40). However, the system or network that best 
ensures full vascularization is the one that includes both 
the Radial recurrent  (RRA) and the Interosseous recurrent 
arteries (IRA), plus the distal section of the PRCA.
a) RRA-IRA-PRCA. The Radial recurrent, Interosseous 
recurrent and Posterior collateral radial arteries system. 
For a flap based in this plexus, the PRCA has to be divided 
and ligated proximally to the point where the Radial recur -rent artery branches off and the flap is raised, including the 
distal portion of the three arteries: the PRCA, the RRA and 
the IRA (see fig 6.44). The pedicle containing the RRA and 
IRA (and the distal portion of the PRCA) is dissected sub -
fascially down to within 2 cm proximal of the lateral epicon -
dyle. It is almost impossible to individualize these recurrent 
arteries - the Radial and the Interosseous. Thus, if the flap 
is to be based on this system, it should be raised on a short 
fasciosubcutaneous pedicle, where these two arteries are 
included(59). Including the RRA and the IRA, together with 
the distal part of the PRCA, enhances the flap vasculariza -
tion; through the arc of rotation is limited exclusively to the 
elbow region.
b) IRA-PCRA. The flap can also be based on the anas -
tomoses between the interosseous recurrent and posteri -
or interosseous arteries and the PRCA (18). According to 
Katsaros(40), skin islands of about 8 cm by 10 cm can be 
elevated on the lateral aspect of the elbow, based on this 
arterial network. These arteries (and veins) are too small 
to be individualized and elevated. The pedicle includes the 
subcutaneous tissue and fascia around the elbow and is 
dissected to within 2 cm proximal of the lateral epicon -
dyle(68).
c) RRA-PRCA. Another option is to raise the flap exclu -
sively based on the anastomosing network between the 
Radial recurrent artery and the Posterior radial collateral ar -
tery(13) (see fig. 6.45). It permits a longer and narrower pedi -
cle, though vascularization of the flap is limited to the RRA.
Figure 6.43. Anteriorly, the flap 
is dissected subfascially from 
the biceps and brachioradialis, 
until the intermuscular  septum 
is reached (where the PRCA 
runs). The vascular pedicle is 
located at the deepest part of 
the septum, very close to the 
humerus bone.

incision is made deep into the 
fascia of the Triceps muscle. 
Elevation continues subfas -
cially until the lateral septum 
is reached. The septum and 
the PRCA are elevated from the 
humeral shaft and the artery is 
divided and ligated proximally 
to the branching of the radi -
al recurrent artery. The white 
dotted lines indicate the inci -
sion lines, to include the radial 
recurrent and the interosseous 
recurrent arteries.

cularization. As in the other 
versions of the flap, the PRCA 
is divided proximally to the RRA 
branching. Elevation follows 
a line that continues distally, 
preserving the distal part of the 
PRCA, anastomosed with the 
RRA, but dividing the network 
of vessels branching off from 
the IRA and continuing down, 
around the epicondyle.
