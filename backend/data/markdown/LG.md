Lower Limb302Figure 7.51. A) Saphenous nerve and vein should be preserved, so they are traced about 2-3 cm from the tibial medial border and the incision marked 
on the medial side of the calf. B) Incision is made deep to the fascia, which is left attached to the skin. 
Figure 7.50. Markings and ref -
erences: The posterior border 
of the Tibia (PBT) is first marked 
out. 2 or 3 cm posterior to that 
border, the greater saphenous 
vein (SV) and the saphenous 
nerve (SaN) course distally from 
the thigh to the posterior aspect 
of the ankle tuberosity. Between 
both gastrocnemius muscles, 
the sural nerve (SuN) courses 
distally to the lateral aspect of 
the ankle and is accompanied by 
the lesser saphenous vein. The 
skin incision is outlined 2 cm 
behind the saphenous vein and 
nerve and curved up posteriorly 
to facilitate access to the mus -
cular head of the gastrocnemius.
 LATERAL GASTROCNEMIUS FLAP
The patient is positioned supine with the ipsilater -
al hip elevated to maintain the limb in a slight internal 
rotation and the knee slightly flexed. Incision is marked 
parallel to, and 2 cm behind the posterior border of the 
fibula and can also be extended proximally to the popli -
teal fossa.
Elevation
The flap is best raised with the patient in the supine 
position, with the hip abducted, slightly flexed and exter -
nally rotated and the knee also partially flexed. Elevation of the muscle is best done under controlled ischemia, 
by using an inflatable tourniquet. Muscle incisions and 
section are rather bloody and this will challenge precise 
identification and isolation of the pedicles. 
The heads of both of the gastrocnemius muscles 
form the lower triangle of the popliteal fossa, with its ver -
tex marking the boundary between each gastrocnemius 
body, which is also separated by a fibrous septum. Deep 
in between the medial and lateral bodies the sural nerve 
is found. The medial gastrocnemius is clearly differenti -
ated in the upper third from the underlying soleus mus -
cle. The long tendon from the plantaris muscle is also 
identified and helps with finding the plane of elevation.

Figure 7.52. A) Subfascial dissection proceeds posteriorly all along the incision, to expose the muscle. B) The belly of the gastrocnemius muscle is 
completely exposed and dissected free from the fascia until the midline is reached and the fibrous septum is found. Deep inside, the sural nerve is 
seen. It should be dissected free the muscle and respected.
Figure 7.53. In between the Medial gastrocnemius (MG) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) lies the upper portion of the sural nerve (black arrows). Soleus 
muscle (So) is seen deep inside.

Figure 7.54. A) Occasionally, the sural nerve (1) courses inside a fibrous tunnel (2) that should be opened to be traced and keep the nerve respected 
from the Medial gastrocnemius (MG) elevation.

Figure 7.55. The posterior cutaneous flap is rejected and the sural nerve (arrows) can be seen running over the soleus muscle between both gastroc -
nemius muscles. It is kept apart towards the posterior aspect to initiate the elevation of the muscle belly.

Figure 7.56. A) Distally, elevation of the common tendon of the gastrocnemius from the soleus is easily achieved by blunt dissection. B) Proximally, 
the medial body has to be freed with knife or scissors.

Figure 7.57. The right plane of dissection between the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles is confirmed by the presence of the long, narrow tendon of 
the plantaris muscle (arrows).

Lower Limb306Figure 7.58. Medial to the long tendon of the plantaris muscle, gastrocnemius elevation is easily done with blunt scissors. Any perforator vessel 
traversing this plane is ligated and divided.
Figure 7.59. The common tendon of the gastrocnemius is elevated and split into two segments: the one that is included with the medial gastrocnemius 
and the one which remains attached to the soleus muscle and the common Achilles tendon.

Figure 7.61. The muscle usually rotates with facility but if it is still short, fasciotomies at different levels can be performed (exclusively the fascia). 
This enables some 2 or 3 cm more length. Figure 7.60. Finally, elevation is completed towards the popliteal zone. However especial care has to be taken laterally where the pedicle enters the 
muscle.
Occasionally, the flap can be further mobilized by 
transferring the muscle under the tendons of Gracilis 
and semitendinous muscle. This manoeuvre effective -
ly allows the muscle to reach the proximal aspect of the knee or distal part of the anterior femur. However, 
under these tendons the proximal part of the muscle 
will be tight and at risk of becoming congested or isch -
emic.
