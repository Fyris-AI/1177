309Soleus flap (Proximally and distally based)
 SOLEUS FLAP (PROXIMALLY AND DISTALLY BASED)
The soleus muscle is located at the posterior aspect 
of the leg, deep into the gastrocnemius that is usually 
large, broad and long, but can vary from one patient to 
another, and can also be quite short.
It was described as a local pedicled flap to repair 
defects at the medial and distal aspect of the leg by 
Ger(40,41) and popularized by Mathes and Nahai(103). 
Since then, this muscle has been used as proximally 
based, distally based(31,93,134,146), either partial(145,159) or to -
tal muscle flap(40,101), muscle-adipose(44) or muscle-ten -
don(16) muscle-skin-bone(22) composite flaps or free 
flap(75,124).
Despite all published variations and indications, this 
flap is generally used as a proximally based, entire mus -
cle flap transposition, because:
• There is not a single dominant pedicle that can ade -
quately vascularize the entire muscle segment, 
• Vascularization emerges from different source vessels 
(posterior tibial and peroneal arteries),
• Hemisoleus flaps are usually too narrow to cover current 
size defects found on middle and distal third defects.
• All pedicles are rather short and will limit rotation, and
• Respecting a muscle segment by raising only one of the 
bodies (lateral or medial) does not significantly preserve 
post-operative ankle function.
 
However, there are also some advantages that 
have to be balance out with the mentioned disadvan -
tages:
• Independent innervation and vascularization and bipeni -
form morphology allows for separate harvesting of each 
muscular belly.
• Practically the only open option to effectively cover distal 
bone defects of the tibia.
• Has a constant blood supply. 
With all this in mind, what follows is the procedure to 
elevate the soleus muscle flap, proximally based as an 
entire unit, or as a partial soleus muscle flap, based on its 
distal pedicle.Indications
Although the soleus flap can be elevated as a com-
posite flap including fascia, muscle, tendon (partial 
Achilles tendon), bone (head of the fibula) and skin (skin 
overlying the fibula head), the classical and more widely 
deployed use for this flap is coverage of defects of the 
middle third of the tibia. Defect localization and size will 
determine the type of flap (pedicled, hemisoleus, free…), 
but the size and length of the soleus muscle, can vary 
between patients and may also determine indications. 
Sometimes soleus muscle is present with a long body, 
which is able to reach the distal third of the leg, while in 
other patients the muscle is broad, thick but rather short 
and difficult to rotate even for middle third defects. In 
these cases (short muscles) it may be preferable to use 
the medial hemisoleus flap, which is more versatile and 
mobile(101), though it is obviously narrow and indicated for 
limited narrow defects.
Indications can be summarized as follows:
• Medial third defects of the leg, usually post-traumatic in -
juries to the tibia. In the case of minor bone defects (less 
than 5 cm long), conventional bone grafts or one-stage 
ipsilateral fibula transfer with the muscle can provide 
vascularized bone to the defect(9,31,40,41,93,122).
• Distal third defects of the leg, can be repaired with a dis -
tally based medial soleus flap, but the distal minor pedi -
cle is not fully reliable and a second option has to be kept 
in mind.
• Achilles tendon injuries and defects(16,44).
• Maxillo-mandibular reconstruction(9,120).
Anatomy and Vascularization
The soleus muscle is a large, broad and usually 
long muscle (though in certain patients it can be rather 
short) located deep to the gastrocnemius muscle at the 
posterior aspect of the leg. It has two heads, the medi -
al and lateral separated at its distal part in the midline 
by a septum. The lateral head originates from the fibula 
head and shaft, while the medial head originates from 
the medial side of the middle third of the tibia (see fig. 
7.123). Both heads join together to form the dorsomedi -

## Page 2

Lower Limb310al and dorsolateral part of the Achilles tendon with the 
fibers coming from the gastrocnemius muscle. Both 
heads, through the Achilles tendon, insert to the calca -
neum tuberosity.
Vascular supply and innervation according to Baudet 
et al.(9) is:
a. Lateral soleus muscle is vascularized by three ped -
icles and innervated by branches from the medial 
popliteal and tibial nerves. Upper and middle pedicles 
come from collateral branches branching off from 
the peroneal vessels, while the inferior pedicle comes 
from the posterior tibial artery.
• Upper pedicle is constant and dominant and pene -
trates the muscle 2.2 cm below the fibula head (fig. 
7.62 B-8 Sp).
• Middle pedicle consists of two branches (fig. 7.62 B-11 
Mp). The upper branch of this middle pedicle originat -
ed from the tibioperoneal or the peroneal arteries and penetrates the muscle at approximately 7.5 cm from 
the head of the fibula. The lower branch originates 
from the peroneal artery and enters the muscle at 9.9 
cm from the head of the fibula.
• Inferior pedicle is absent in 18% of patients and branch -
es off from the peroneal artery (50%) or the posterior 
tibial artery (50%) (fig. 7.62 B-16 Ip).
b. Medial soleus muscle is vascularized by several ves-
sels branching off the peroneotibial and posterior 
tibial vessels and is innervated by branches from the 
posterior tibial nerve. The medial belly has three dom-
inant pedicles and some other minor ones:
• Upper pedicle: branches emerging from the tibial artery 
(fig. 7.62 B-9 Sp).
• Middle pedicle: Branch emerging from the peroneal ar -
tery (fig. 7.62 B-12 Mp).
• Inferior pedicle: Branch from the posterior tibial artery 
(fig. 7.62 B-17 Ip).

Lower Limb312Markings
For these highly versatile flaps, design and outlining 
will finally depend upon whether the flap has to include 
the following: a cutaneous paddle (or not), a fibula frag -
ment or tendon fragment, or will be raised as a whole so-
leus muscle, a lateral belly or medial belly, or will be raised 
as proximally based, distally based or free flap.
If the soleus muscle is transferred with a cutaneous 
paddle, the island has to be outlined on the upper third of 
the lateral soleus muscle, as it is there where the main mus -
culocutaneous perforator vascularizes the overlying skin.
As mentioned above, it is important to be aware of the 
length of the muscle; as some can reach the malleoli and 
others are rather short for that goal. For those patients 
with long muscle bellies, these can be transferred prox-
imally based, to repair distal third defects of the leg. For 
those soleus muscles that are rather short, if proximally 
based, they will only be able to give covering to middle 
third leg defects.
Medial approach: A line is traced from the medial 
malleolus up to the proximal third of the leg at 1.5 cm 
posterior to the medial border of the tibia. On reaching the 
proximal third of the leg, if necessary, the line is continued 
as an “S-shaped” incision to the popliteal fossa for better 
exposure of the pedicle.
Lateral approach: A line is traced longitudinally from 
the lateral malleolus, along the fibula axis up to the fibula 
neck. The skin incision starts at the junction of the middle 
and distal third, and continues up over the traced lined to the fibula neck, where it bends towards the popliteal 
fossa.
Composite soleus flap: To elevate the soleus muscle 
as a musculocutaneous or composite fibular-musculocu -
taneous flap (fig. 7.75), the skin island should then be out -
lined more posteriorly than the usual muscular approach; 
centered over the septum, between the lateral soleus and 
peroneus longus, as it is from there that the septocutane-
ous perforator vessels emerge to the skin. These perfo-
rators are usually found at the upper third of the leg and 
consequently it is from the upper third, where the cutane-
ous paddle has to be harvested.
Elevation
Medial soleus muscle flap
Elevation of the muscle is best done under controlled 
ischemia by using an inflatable tourniquet. Muscle inci -
sions and section are rather bloody and this will challenge 
precise identification and isolation of the pedicles. In order 
to preserve the mechanics and function of the gastrocne -
mius-Achilles tendon, the soleus muscle and fascia have 
to be carefully divided proximally, to the Achilles tendon.
It is important to highlight the fact that pedicles for 
distally based soleus flaps are not consistent and reli-
able. If a distally based soleus is planned, distal pedicles 
should be explored and identified, before any proximal 
vascular supply or muscle fibers are divided.
Figure 7.63. Muscular soleus 
flap approach: Great saphe -
nous vein (SV) and saphenous 
nerve (SaN) are usually found, 
two fingers width posterior to 
the posterior border of the tibia 
(PBT). A longitudinal incision is 
then outlined posterior to these 
structures.

Lower Limb318Figure 7.74. Once free, the medial soleus distally based can be rotated to give coverage to the distal third of the tibia.
If the intention is to harvest the soleus as a proximally 
based flap, the proximal pedicle is then preserved and the 
distal one divided and ligated. The soleus aponeurosis 
is then distally released from the gastrocnemius, sepa-
rating both components of the Achilles tendon.Then the 
soleus component is divided.
Lateral soleus composite flap
To elevate the soleus muscle as a muscle, muscu -
locutaneous or composite fibular-muscle flap, the cuta -
neous incision has to respect the vessels that vascular -
ize the skin. These vessels emerge through the septum 
between the soleus and peroneus muscles at the upper 
third of the leg. The incision for either the osteocutane -
ous flap or the musculocutaneous island flap should 
then be outlined more posteriorly than usual, over the 
septum, between the lateral soleus and peroneus longus 
muscle.Though the composite soleus muscle is not part of this 
book, an overview and some technical details about this 
version of the flap are discussed below. Harvesting the flap 
is similar to the osteocutaneous fibula flap. The vessels 
supplying the skin from the peroneal artery run through 
the septum between the posterior aspect of the peroneus 
brevis and longus and the anterior aspect of the lateral so -
leus. The particular section of septum, the fibula fragment, 
a portion of the lateral soleus muscle and the peroneal ves -
sels should be preserved and harvested as a compound 
unit. As for the fibula flap, a generous cuff of muscle fibers 
should be left attached to the bone and septum to avoid 
accidental damage to the vessels. Great care has to be tak -
en to safely perform the fibula osteotomy with a Gigli saw.
However, especially if the skin island is rather small, 
perforators should be previously localized by Doppler as-
sistance, and precisely identified by direct visualization, 
before incising the entire perimeter of the skin paddle.

free, the medial soleus distally based can be rotated to give coverage to the distal third of the tibia.

Lower Limb320After care management: The patient has to remain in 
bed for approximately 10 days under strict supervision in 
case of microvascular transfer (vasodilation and/or anti-
thrombotic drugs).  
As with all perforator flaps,but especially when a muscle 
or musculocutaneous flap has been harvested, the recipient 
site has to be immobilized and protected by a posterior splint 
for at least 2 or 3 weeks. This has to be kept under control 
to avoid local compression to the flap or the pedicle. The 
leg has to be kept elevated to facilitate venous drainage and 
physiotherapy is used to prevent edema and joint stiffness.
In the case of composite flaps transferring a fragment of fibula, a circumferential cast will replace the splint and 
has to be maintained until consolidation of the bone frag -
ment has been confirmed (it may take 1 year).
When the flap only includes the muscle belly, it can 
be skin grafted at the same time or postponed for a few 
days, to check if the entire muscle is viable and safe, or 
superficial or deep muscle necrosis have occurred. 
Transferring the entire muscle or one of its bellies, as 
happens when using the gastrocnemius flap, will leave a 
visible scar on the lateral aspect of the calf and will also 
leave a moderate contour deformity and asymmetry 
when compared with the other leg.Figure 7.77. Composite soleus muscle (osteocutaneous muscular) flap1. Safety muscular cuff around the bone
