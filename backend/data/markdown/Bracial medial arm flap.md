189Brachial Medial arm flap
Medial aspect of the arm is an excellent donor area 
for flaps because its skin is highly elastic and has an 
excellent texture, colour and thickness, especially when 
they are intended to resurface skin defects over joints 
such as the elbow (reverse pedicled flaps) or axilla (prox-
imally based pedicled flaps). 
The skin of the inner arm is vascularized by terminal 
septocutaneous branches from the Brachial artery, the 
Superior ulnar collateral artery and the Middle ulnar col -
lateral artery (when present) that arise through the sep-
tum between the Biceps and Triceps.
Based on these perforators a variety of flaps have 
been described:
• The Medial arm flap (proximally or distally based) that 
is vascularized by terminal septocutaneous branches 
emerging from the Superior ulnar collateral artery.
• The Distal medial arm flap, a reverse fasciocutaneous 
perforator flap based on the main perforator from the 
Distal brachial artery.
• The Reverse ulnar recurrent perforator artery flap based 
on branches from the anastomosis, between the Superi -
or ulnar collateral artery and the Ulnar recurrent artery.The most reliable vessel in this area is the Superior 
ulnar collateral artery, which is the source vessel for the 
Medial arm flap. This artery anastomoses distally with the 
posterior Ulnar recurrent artery and that is why this flap, 
when it is distally based and distally outlined, is known as 
the Ulnar recurrent fasciocutaneous flap.
Indications
As pedicle flaps, Medial arm perforator flaps are espe-
cially useful to resurface distal defects around the elbow 
(distally based flap)(48) or defects on the shoulder or axil-
la(10). As free flaps they have been widely used for many 
reconstructive challenges.
Vascularization and anatomy
The Medial arm flap is vascularized by the Superior 
ulnar collateral artery that branches off from the Bra -
chial artery at about midpoint of the upper arm and, 
according to Cormack and Lamberty(17), has a diameter 
of about 2-3 mm (see fig. 6.1) and gives one or two sep -
tocutaneous perforators that reach the skin, emerging  BRACHIAL MEDIAL ARM FLAP

muscles. This artery is closely related to the ulnar and 
median nerves all along its course down to the elbow, 
where it anastomoses with the posterior (and indirectly 
the anterior) Recurrent ulnar artery. Sensory innervation 
to the skin of the medial aspect of the arm is supplied 
by the intercostobrachial nerve (proximal third of the in -
ner arm) and by the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm 
(middle and distal third) (see fig. 6.18).
Markings
The reference points to mark the axis over which the 
island flap will be outlined, are the Coracoid point and the medial epicondyle. (Refer to legends in figure 6.19). The 
cutaneous island can be outlined over the entire area of 
the arm’s inner skin. However, it is important to harvest 
the flap in such manner that the donor area can be re-
paired by direct closure; avoiding skin grafts on an area 
where structures of great importance are located; such 
as the Brachial artery, median and ulnar nerve.
Elevation
The same as with most perforator flaps, elevation al-
ways starts firstly on one of its sides and only when a 
reliable perforator and nourishing vessels have been iden-
tified, the rest of the perimeter can be incised deeply.
Figure 6.19. By pulse palpa -
tion, the brachial artery (Br.
Art.) is marked  reference over 
the skin of the inner aspect of 
the arm. Coracoid point (CP) 
and medial epicondyle point 
(ME) are marked out and a 
line is traced between them. 
The Mid point over this line is 
marked (MP) and represents 
the point where the superior 
ulnar collateral artery branch -
es off from the brachial artery. 
The cutaneous paddle of the 
flap is outlined as an ellipse 
distal to this point.
Figure 6.20. Medial incision 
is carried deep to the fascia. 
Great care is taken to localize 
and preserve the intercosto -
braquial nerve. Later it will be 
decided how proximally it will 
be divided, to keep the flap 
sensitive.

collateral artery (SUCA) are also identified and kept attached medially to the septum. B) Septum is completely freed from medial attachments to 
Triceps muscle. Basilic vein (BV) will appear when dissecting proximally.

muscle. B) Elevation continues medially to reach the intermuscular septum where some septocutaneous perforators emerging from the Brachial 
artery are usually found.
